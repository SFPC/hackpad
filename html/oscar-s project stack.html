<body><h1>oscar&rsquo;s project stack&nbsp;</h1><p><b>SMALL SUMMARY</b></p><p>i just made a small dot point summary of things we&rsquo;ve looked at. it&rsquo;s not exhaustive in any way, and includes projects and ideas of my own, but thought i&rsquo;d share anyway. <a href='https://www.dropbox.com/s/28m1zrn9nqzlz1h/Summary.rtf'/>Summary.rtf</a></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><b>Interviews</b></p><p>I&rsquo;m currently transcribing the short interviews we&rsquo;ve done over the past few days. I want to present them visually somehow on Sunday so that people visiting can see them. If anyone has any ideas as to how I could do this/wants to help with the visual presentation, let me know.</p><p></p><p>Project for Monday 28 April</p><p></p><p><b>Permutations Tweet Project</b></p><p>Today I want to get started on an idea I have for a Twitter/Web project called <b>Four Letter Words</b>. It is inspired by that project &rsquo;Every Icon&rsquo; that Zach showed us that goes through every combination of a grid of squares. Basically I want to make a website that runs through every combination of four letter words from AAAA to ZZZZ. This is: 456976. If I make a <b>bot</b> to tweet one of these every minute it would take me just less than a year. An issue I might have is getting suspended by Twitter for too much tweeting. An possible solution might be creating a website that has a counter - AAAA - that changes every minute, and only tweets those combinations that correspond to a word in the dictionary. If anyone is interested in helping out with this project let me know.</p><ul class="task"><li>Log to the console combination of 3 letter and 4 letter words</li><ul><li>For Loop prototype</li></ul>

<p><a href='/ep/profile/AUZb6pnTdHj'/>Zach Lieberman</a> brought in a book called Void by <b>Elodie Lareine. </b>It uses a multitude of text arranged in certain patterns, and when flipped, provides a visual &rsquo;narrative&rsquo;, or poem. Conceptually, it is indebted to Jorge Luis Borges story <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel'/>&rsquo;The Library of Babel&rsquo;</a>, in that it purports to be one of the books in the infinite library. Using text for visual representation made me think of old school ASCII art: imagine translating an entire movie, still by still, into text...etc...</p><p></p><p><a href='/ep/profile/uCZ3kD8pFvb'/>Taeyoon Choi</a> asked us to think of a game to play with Pierre Reverdy&rsquo;s poem, &rsquo;At Dawn&rsquo;. For fun I was just using Chrome&rsquo;s speech-to-text function, which, as I&rsquo;m sure you all know, isn&rsquo;t great. Here is a screen shot of my recitation of the poem and underneath is the original... Maybe we could use Arduino to do something funny like this... I don&rsquo;t know.</p><p></p><p><img src='https://hackpad-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/hackpad.com_CAf3F1P2WvF_p.157616_1398394414093_Screen Shot 2014-04-24 at 10.49.53 pm.png'/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img src='https://hackpad-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/hackpad.com_CAf3F1P2WvF_p.157616_1398394509443_Screen Shot 2014-04-24 at 10.54.49 pm.png'/></p><p></p><ul class="task"><li>think about how to organise the data from bot or not</li>
