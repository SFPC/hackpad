<body><h1>sfpc 4 weeks&nbsp;</h1><p></p><p>Please write your comments, concerns, thoughts and questions about sfpc here for Amit, Jen, Zach and Taeyoon to respond.&nbsp;</p><p></p><ul><li>Evening classes are tough for me, especially three times a week.&nbsp; I think others feel the same?&nbsp; I realize they&rsquo;re necessary for this session, but it&rsquo;s something to consider for the future.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m a little worried about spreading myself thin — too many interesting things going on!</li>
<li>Although I&rsquo;m enjoying the circuits class quite a lot, I also feel like it might not be as practical for me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve studied/built these logic circuits in the past, and think I would prefer to be working out other circuits that I&rsquo;d be more likely to use in practice.&nbsp; I guess I&rsquo;m also concerned about spending 6+ hours a week on the circuits class, since our time at the school is limited.</li></ul>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking alot about direction of the circuit class for the second half of sfpc.&nbsp;</p><p>I&rsquo;m collecting a list of themes and topics from students to do future circuit class after this first four weeks. After we make Flilp Flop (or SR Latch), we can move on to Sound, Motor, Sensors, Wireless communication and microcontrollers. Some of topics will be covered by guest lectures (during two weeks I will be away) Some of these topics might be interesting to only few people, and that&rsquo;s fine.&nbsp; We might not be able to do everything in the list, but it will help to plan to deliver what you need the most. Sign by the topic if you want to learn about these things..&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>so far...</p><ul><li>Sound/ Synth making- andy (definitely) and more&nbsp; (TY)</li>
<li>Analog Amp- tega, andy (TY)</li>
<li>Wearables (soft electronics: fabric, paper, etc)- rachel jesse(TY or Kaho Abe)</li>
<li>Motor control (especially stepper motors! they can be tricky but super useful) -many,andy (TY)</li>
<li>Logic chips for microcontrollers: mux/demux/shift registers - jon jesse andy(TY)</li>
<li>Wireless- rachel jesse (Dan Phiffer/ confirmed)&nbsp;</li>
<li>RFID/ radio modulation -rachel jesse (Maybe Zach? or invite someone)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Integrating software/hardware effectively - jon jesse (Caitlin Morris, visiting lecturer, will be able to help)</li>
<li>Memory, ALU, CU, Registers, verilog, VHDL, CPLD&nbsp; (In case if you want to dig deeper into logic stuff)- moises, Ishac, (TY&rsquo;s specialty)&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C'/>I2C&nbsp;</a> - jon (find someone)&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p>I would also like to have more time to concentrate on our own work. It feels like a big chunk of our time is taken up by classes or rushing to finish homework for classes. Perhaps we could choose which classes we&rsquo;d like to attend – so that if we wanted to work on a project/learn code/read during classtime we could do so without feeling like a terrible person. I wish I could absorb everything but it feels like there is so much being thrown around that I&rsquo;m not actually taking in anything!</p><p></p><ul style="list-style: none;"><li>(I&rsquo;m totally cool with having classes be more optional, I was planning on my I/O workshops things being more or less people can sign up for.&nbsp; I will try that for the animation ones next week.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m definitely of the mind set that the first rule is work, and that if you are in the space and working, but maybe not attending everything you are still being an active member.&nbsp; Some people work better with homework, and sometimes it&rsquo;s useful to work on problems simultaneously, but you should also feel enough freedom and space to work at your own rhythm.)</li>
<li><br/></li></ul>
<ul><li>tinkering vs thinking: I&rsquo;m a beginner to circuits, so tinkering is more necessary than listening a lecture for learning. It&rsquo;s nice if the lecture of circuits from Taeyoon and tinkering circuits with Taeyoon were on same time.&nbsp;</li>
<li>logistics: I need a correct calendar since I missed last Zach&rsquo;s cv class.</li>
<li>for coming working term: an idea sharing board <a href='http://ameblo.jp/ksdkjp/image-10184199760-10124129421.html'/>like this</a> might be necessary for our discussion, collaboration, fork project each other. (Also the questions board have been dead for a couple of weeks, this should be more pretty...?)</li></ul>

<p></p><ul><li>I hope that the amount of structured class/lecture time doesn&rsquo;t disappear too quickly, but instead it makes more sense to make some lectures optional. I think it would be a shame to give us too much free work time yet, I&rsquo;m learning so much from the challenges that Zach gives us, and I want this to continue from all of the teachers, please keep the classes coming (optionally)! We have a huge workload, but for me personally I feel it&rsquo;s too soon to only work indipendently.</li>
<li>I agree with Motoi about the calendars, lots of classes are moving around or being cancelled and it would be great to keep the Google calendar up to date as soon as a change happens.<ul><li>I noticed that because everybody is always here, the whiteboard calendar has become the most frequently updated and visible place to look for a current schedule. I think everybody in the school is an editor on the SFPC Google calendar, so it&rsquo;d be great if everyone could take part in keeping the calendar up to the date with both classes (as they shift around) and also interesting events around NYC.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Math questions in Jen&rsquo;s class: I do have some larger math questions that I hope to get pointed in the right direction with before we get too close to the end, it would be great to get some help soonish. My worry is discovering that my answers are in a volumes of books too close to the end of the course, without the time left for the self study that I&rsquo;d like to be doing when teachers are present.</li></ul>
