When you pour ceramics over the computer to create the object, it becomes alive and starts counting as it disappears inside the object. The computer counts for itself, it&rsquo;s its life clock - it doesn&rsquo;t communicate it&rsquo;s status, or tells when it dies. Its appearance is always inert.</p><p>___</p><p></p><p></p><p><b>Sampling time with X</b></p><p></p><p><img src='https://hackpad-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/hackpad.com_Rt6HUtbBzw5_p.77457_1383420480319_time.jpeg'/>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>We use time to sample space, sound, light, etc. What does it mean to sample time with any of those?</p><p>___</p><p></p><p></p><p><b>About perception of time and space</b></p><p></p><p><img src='https://hackpad-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/hackpad.com_Rt6HUtbBzw5_p.77457_1383420493759_clock.jpeg'/>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>A clock and a ruler that represent a personal perception of time.

Only if all sub patterns are recognized, the master pattern is <i>true</i>.

I put together (it&rsquo;s in my sketchbook at school, feel free to check it out) but we can go through the hackpads and prioritize, and see how far we can go.</p><p></p><p>I also really like your question of what it means to sample through time. I&rsquo;d love to discuss this more?</p><p>Maybe this relates in some way to <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity'/>relativity</a>? Prior to Einstein, no one could explain why when you accelerate towards a body, time speeds up and when you move away from it, time appears to slow down. This was because it was (incorrectly) assumed that time was a constant. Einstein was able to reconsider this assumption and suggest that actually time dilates - ie. it is not constant and rather the space/time relationship is the constant. So I&rsquo;m not quite sure where this tangent is going...but I guess that sampling assumes a constant flow of time?&nbsp;</p><p>With Dahan we&rsquo;re discussing the fact that we use time to sample everything - space, sound, even activities. It helps analyse patterns, average, etc. considering, of course, that the time gradients are constant. As you say, in certain situations, the samples won&rsquo;t be constant as we understand them. Is then when it makes sense to sample time with something else -constant- that allows to see the time variations. We didn&rsquo;t get anywhere specific yet, but our open question was what would it mean, or how would we represent time as the variable we want to sample, selecting different secondary variables to slice it. With some pair of variables is easy to just switch the axis and it makes sense, with time is super abstract. Maybe the way to approach it is maths, and probably there are examples. Let&rsquo;s chat!</p><p>Also, sampling requires taking a guess at a frequency (or scale). It only reveals phenomena around happening slower than the sampling rate. Things happening at much faster frequencies remain invisible (things above the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_frequency'/>Nyquist frequency</a>) - of course this is called aliasing. What does this mean for your question? I don&rsquo;t know :) But that&rsquo;s an interesting aspect too!</p><p></p><p>i love all of these ideas, i said already few weeks ago, id be happy to help out/ collaborate on the book and electronic projects. Im bringing some more stuff in tomorrow, to show you and others some options with counting and latching memory. note (Wed: synth for Andy) (Tue or Thur: sound for Le)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p></body>
