<body><h1>Financial Transparency</h1><p>[DRAFT!]</p><p></p><p>We plan to continue sharing the School for Poetic Computation&rsquo;s financial statements and narratives publicly on an ongoing basis. Previous administrative records can be accessed at:&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><a href="http://github.com/sfpc/finance-and-administration"></a><a href='http://github.com/sfpc/finance-and-administration'/>http://github.com/sfpc/finance-and-administration</a></p><p></p><p>This means: if you pay SFPC or SFPC pays you, you consent to SFPC publishing on a public webpage on the internet: your name (or that of your organization), a dollar amount, and a short description of what was exchanged. We ask for your consent (and explicit communication of problems or questions) in advance of our exchange, so that we don&rsquo;t have to double back before publishing. We (who to take in and spend money on behalf of SFPC) will do our best to make the project of publishing our finances and its implications known to everyone we exchange money with, especially when it may disclose the price of things for which there is not already a public &quot;sticker price&quot; or listed value.</p><p></p><p>We share our finances out of a spirit of radical openness and generosity. We are trying to push ourselves beyond what is normal, comfortable, and perhaps reasonable when it comes to &quot;openness.&quot; It&rsquo;s our hope that members of our organization as well as organizers of future schools will find our financial information useful, but also that it can spark discussions about the industries of art, technology, and education. We hope that our openness can establish trust, or at least help people locate trust.</p><p></p><p>However, people are more important to us than an experiment about numbers. If for reasons of health, safety, or personal privacy (to name a few) you need to have your information redacted or obfuscated, we can discuss how to do this. (We have not yet had to permanently scrub information.) You can reach the school&rsquo;s founders by email at: <a href='mailto:info@sfpc.io'/>info@sfpc.io</a>.</p><p></p><ul class="comment"><li>&nbsp;has nothing to say as this sums it up pretty clearly the what and why ...</li>
