<body><h1>Nathan&rsquo;s Stuff</h1><p>To Do:</p><ul class="taskdone"><li>populate this document.</li></ul>
<p><b>**SOME THOUGHTS**</b></p><ul><li>Story. Narrative. For any Sfpc project I do to feel meaningful to me, I&rsquo;m going to need this. Be it a composition that feels like it has a beginning and an end, to a program, I&rsquo;m going to need a story; to <i>tell </i>one! ...}else it&rsquo;s just rudiments and exercise (not that there is anything wrong with that, but I can do that at home).</li></ul>
<p><b>**PROJECT IDEAS**</b></p><ul><li>Waveform visualization program. Frequency dependent.<ul><li>&nbsp;could this plugin to Logic .ovm files for refining complex editing tasks?</li>
<li>could compression algo (mp3) be used to visualize important data in a waveform to make editing easier?</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Spoken chess app for handsfree or blindfold chess.&nbsp;<ul><li>&nbsp;API to integrate with chess.com?</li>
<li>&nbsp;This has assistive potential</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Music app<ul><li>&nbsp;an ableton&nbsp; style app that allows you to click or record blocks of music snippets that you could record or play. This could be used for arranging song ideas or as a performance tool</li>
<li>&nbsp;Arpeggiators as functions.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Portable DAW/Kaossilator style music device. Sample environment, detect pitch, apply harmonic manipulations to create tones based on overtones. arpeggiate, instrument, synth, sampler</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Program a miles an hour to minutes calculator<ul><li>just seems an easy excersise.&nbsp;</li></ul>
</li>
<li>List/to-do app<ul><li>ie Omnifocus, lifebalance style task management.</li>
<li>what would this look like if I made something customized for myself?</li>
<li>its something I&rsquo;ve thought a lot about...</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Camera app supporting notes.<ul><li>why can&rsquo;t I append/tag my photos with notes when I take them?&nbsp;</li>
<li>i.e. someone shows me a cool bird and tells me about it. I want to snap a picture. But i want the name of the bird with it and maybe a website etc.&nbsp;</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Program a web app for file sharing<ul><li>a more elegant way of implementing this:</li>
<li><a href="http://files.doghouseNYC.com"></a>http://files.doghouseNYC.com&nbsp;</li></ul>
</li>
<li>I want to make something with a rotary phone. Why? I just do.&nbsp; Because they are awesome. And pulse dialing is neat.</li>
<li>Use a lizard in a project. (partly because I have one). I&rsquo;m only half joking. Maybe 4/5 joking. I think Beardo would enjoy being an installation.</li>
<li>VR Ping pong using iPhone camera. Could sound be implemented in a cool/musical way?<ul><li>I imagine playing with someone else or against a wall (like handball)<ul><li>bluetooth?</li></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><b>**Geez... COULDN&rsquo;T ALMOST <i>ANYTHING</i> BE A LANGUAGE?**</b></p><ul><li>Chess as language</li>
<li>the bouncing ball game with sound that I was thinking of. Language???</li></ul>
<p><b>**SOME RANDOM QUESTIONS**</b></p><ul><li>Ugh. Um...I just sorta need help.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not exactly sure how to ask. It&rsquo;s partly that I (like everyone else) is overwhelmed. But I think it&rsquo;s a little beyond that. I don&rsquo;t want to overwhelm everyone else because I know everyone else is saturated as too. But I&rsquo;m feeling like I&rsquo;m struggling with basic stuff on every front and it&rsquo;s beginning to paralyze me.<ul><li>maybe someone could spend time with me looking over my shoulder while I try to figure stuff out - just preventing me from spinning my wheels on the stupid stuff and helping me clarify my problem solving process.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>How can I best maximize my existing assets and skills?<ul><li>studio, creative/musical, business/project management, flexibility (knowing a little bit about a lot of things).</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Are the processes of &quot;DSP theory &quot; and &quot;learning to code&quot; complimentary? Or is it a can of worms and I should hold off till later.<ul><li>Is using Max a crutch/shortcut that I should avoid?</li></ul>
</li>
<li>how do you deal (programmatically) with non graphical stuff?<ul><li>ie. a database, or referencing a file?</li></ul>
</li>
<li>How do you decide when is it more efficient to code simple scripts from scratch (for example: making an object in Unity clickable/draggable), or when is it best to use pre-existing libraries/tools?</li>
<li>What languages should I be learning?</li>
<li>How do I get shit onto my phone. I have the dev license... i think.</li>
<li>What are some ways that people like to approach &quot;prototyping&quot;?</li></ul>
<p><b>**SHOULD I DO THESE WORKSHOPS?**</b></p><ul><li>fuling creative process - creating/delivering on short notice</li>
<li>synth programming</li>
<li>chess as narrative/decision making/logic</li>
<li>making hot sauce. ...with bacon.</li>
<li>how music works (easy harmony/music theory/launchpad)</li></ul>
