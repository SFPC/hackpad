Among those who were buried in Green-wood&rsquo;s potter&rsquo;s field was the assistant of Louis Daguerre. He as on tour of America spreading the invention of photography when he died. His body was unclaimed and he was put to rest in an unmarked grave.&nbsp;</p><p>For everyone who didn&rsquo;t know what a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daguerreotype'/>daguerreotype</a> is:</p><ul style="list-style: none;"><li>The <b>daguerreotype</b> <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English'/>/</a><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key'/>dəˈɡɛrɵtaɪp</a><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English'/>/</a> (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language'/>French</a>: <i>daguerréotype</i>) process (also called<b>daguerreotypy</b>) was the first publicly announced <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography'/>photographic</a> process<sup><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daguerreotype#cite_note-1'/>[1]</a></sup> and the first to come into widespread use during the early 1840s. By the early 1860s, later processes which were less expensive and produced more easily viewed images had almost entirely replaced it. A small-scale revival of daguerreotypy among photographers interested in historical processes was increasingly apparent during the 1980s and 1990s and has persisted into the 2010s.</li></ul>
