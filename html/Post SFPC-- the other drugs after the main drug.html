<body><h1>Post SFPC-- the other drugs after the main drug</h1><p></p><p>several of us spoke about doing a google hangout post sfpc along with a reading.</p><p>i propose that we do the reading Tega suggested last-- don&rsquo;t think we ever got around to it.</p><p></p><p>She wrote on Nov. 6th:</p><p>Hi all,&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>For those interested Ive chosen the first couple of chapters of Jaron Lanier&rsquo;s You Are Not a Gadget since he&rsquo;s come up a bunch of times lately.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Its an easy read so lets try and do the first two chapters of the excerpt attached. (see Tega&rsquo;s email for attachment)</p><p></p><p>**</p><p></p><p>I could set up a doodle so we can pick a time-- but in general-- are there certain days better than others? weekend preferred to weekdays, etc.?</p><p></p><p>just give me a brief idea and maybe we can schedule one hangout before the holidays if some of you are interested. let me know!</p><p></p><p>Anytime is fine for me, with at least a few days notice.</p><p>Some time in the weekend is better for me, probably afternoon NY time so both west coast and europe can join?</p><p>Agreed on the weekend. Before the holidays I feel it&rsquo;s hard, personally I only have one weekend left and many xmas gifts to buy :) but probably next Sunday in the morning (Berlin) could work. Just let me know with some notice.</p><p></p></body>
