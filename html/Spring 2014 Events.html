A.I.R. Gallery invites&nbsp; artists, curators, creative technologists, critics, historians and&nbsp; researchers with an interest in women, art, and technology to join us on&nbsp; April 23 for an evening event. We’ll talk about women trailblazers in&nbsp; new media; enjoy presentations by digital artists; and hold a roundtable&nbsp; discussion to consider these issues within the larger context of the&nbsp; history of art. Our interest is in creating a platform for further&nbsp; conversations and participation at the ﬁrst all female cooperative&nbsp; gallery in the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><b><a href='http://www.eventbrite.com/e/tribeca-storyscapes-special-events-series-in-collaboration-with-bombay-sapphire-gin-tickets-11229141665?aff=estw'/>Tribeca Storyscapes Special Events Series</a> (via Zach)</b></p><p>Here&rsquo;s a link for tickets to free nighttime events at tribeca -- I&nbsp; will be participating in the panel on Clouds, I&rsquo;m really excited to see&nbsp; this project firsthand and hear from others on the panel.</p><p></p><h2>Thu 4/24</h2><p><b><a href='http://blog.papress.com/post/83108406575/the-book-of-trees-lectures-by-author-manuel-lima'/>The Book of Trees, Lectures by author Manuel Lima</a>&nbsp; (via Zach)</b></p><p><b>7pm</b>, Strand Books, New York</p><p></p><h2>Fri 4/25</h2><p><b><a href='http://www.programseries.com/2013-2014/software-studies-a-retrospective/'/>Software Studies Retrospective</a>&nbsp; (via Zach)</b></p><p><i>5:00pm | 8th Fl. 239 Greene St&nbsp;</i></p><p></p><p>Perhaps more than any other object, software structures our everyday&nbsp; engagement with digital media technologies. Software is the interface&nbsp; through which technology becomes accessible for the vast majority of&nbsp; users, and it is through software that we produce, consume, and&nbsp; understand the complex workings of technical systems. Software Studies&nbsp; is a discipline concerned with the critical study of software objects.&nbsp; First proposed by Lev Manovich at the end of his foundational book <i>The Language of New Media</i>,&nbsp; the field has evolved to include a number of divergent methods and&nbsp; practices. This event brings together three key scholars in this&nbsp; emerging field to reflect on how Software Studies has developed and&nbsp; changed over the past ten years, and to look forward to the future of&nbsp; this significant field of practice.</p><p></p><p><b><a href='http://eyebeam.org/events/the-new-romantics'/>New Romantics, Night of Performances @ Eyebeam</a>&nbsp; (via Alexander)</b></p><p>Doors open to Public 6:00PM</p><p></p><p><i>The New Romantics </i>is an exhibition exploring&nbsp; the ways in which contemporary artists using digital media engage the&nbsp; body, representations of nature, poetic irony, and expressions of&nbsp; individuality as originally expressed in 19th Century Romanticism. By&nbsp; drawing equivalences between then and now, this exhibition identifies a&nbsp; critical precedent for artists today that are responding to their ever&nbsp; changing technological environment. Just as the Romantics responded to&nbsp; the industrial revolution, this group of artists are similarly&nbsp; responding to the current information revolution.</p><p>Curators Claudia Hart, Nicholas O’Brien, and Katie&nbsp; Torn have put together an exhibition that illustrates the diversity and&nbsp; complexity of contemporary digital production. In doing so, <i>The New Romantics</i> presents a unique selection of works by artists not based on formal similarities, but on expressive affinities.&nbsp; By employing a myriad of contemporary techniques - including digital&nbsp; fabrication, 3D simulation, software-based collage, video game engines,&nbsp; and peer to peer networking tools - the artists in this exhibition&nbsp; expose an underlying thread of individual expression that extends beyond&nbsp; mere tech-fetishism.</p><p></p><p></p><p><b><a href='http://canopycanopycanopy.com/contents/media_replication_services'/>Media Replication Services</a></b></p><p>6:30pm, Whitney Museum</p><p></p><p>How are the status and meaning of an artwork—whether an Ancient Greek statuary, a digital photograph, or an American naïve painting—altered through the creation of facsimiles, through exhibition, through the conversion of the object into image or code? How might reproduction, as an aesthetic strategy and a political act, present us with alternatives to the current, convoluted understanding of information as property? Media Replication Services will consist of presentations, performances, and provocations in response to these questions by artist William Pope.L, scholar Lisa Gitelman, and poet Caroline Bergvall, facilitated by Triple Canopy editors. The three participants will consider, as points of departure, forms of reproduction enacted in Triple Canopy’s 2014 Biennial installation, <i>Pointing Machines</i>.</p><p></p><p>Caroline Bergvall was the poet who 90% of people voted as &rsquo;bot&rsquo; the other day...

We deeply value public&nbsp; engagement, and consider insights from academics, non-academics, and&nbsp; non-“tech theorists” alike to be equally valuable.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The first Theorizing the Web conference was held in 2011 at the University of Maryland, as was the second in 2012.&nbsp; In 2013, the conference moved to New York, where it was hosted by the&nbsp; CUNY Graduate Center in Manhattan. Theorizing the Web remains in New&nbsp; York for 2014, but is excited to experiment with stepping outside of&nbsp; institutional settings.</p><p></p><p><b>Clement Valla - Transfer Gallery, Bushwick.</b>&nbsp;</p><p>Open saturdays 2-7pm.</p><p><a href="http://transfergallery.com/"></a>http://transfergallery.com/</p><p></p><p><a href='/ep/profile/AReR6wZGJTK'/>Ryota Okawa</a></p><p>*</p><p>&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/ofWorkshop/status/457228669883129856/photo/1"></a>https://twitter.com/ofWorkshop/status/457228669883129856/photo/1</p><p>&nbsp;Shader + OF workshop awesomeness, 2PM at Parsons!</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href='https://remixnyc.com'/>Re/Mixed Media Festival IV</a></p><p></p><p>The RE/Mixed Media Festival is a celebration of collaborative art-making and creative appropriation. It’s the artists’ contribution to the ongoing conversation about remixing, mashups, copyright law, fair use, and the freedom of artists to access their culture in order to add to and build upon it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now in it&rsquo;s fourth year, RE/Mixed Media Festival is a hybrid event -- a marriage of art exhibition and critical academic conference, a forum where artists, activists, scholars, musicians, writers, entertainment professionals, and policymakers come together to collectively re-examine the role of creative appropriation in the arts, and the roles of artists, government and industry in creating and maintaining a free and open culture.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>RE/Mixed Media Festival IV is pleased to welcome media theorist Lev Manovich and author David Shields as keynote speakers, as well as the NY opening of DJ Spooky&rsquo;s international art and design exhibit, the Imaginary App. Other 2014 artists hail from 13 countries, and include 15 students, alumni, and faculty from the New School of Public Engagement&rsquo;s School of Media Studies and Parsons the New School for Design. Past artists and scholars have included Moby, Steinski, Ricky Powell, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Jesper Juul, Nitin Sawhney and over 150 other artists, performers, educators, activists, musicians and DJs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Theresa Lang Center</p><p>55 West 13th Street, second floor, Manhattan</p><p>9a-10p; $5-25</p><p>Continues on SUNDAY</p><p>remixnyc.com</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Sun 4/27</h2><h2>Mon 4/28</h2><h2>Tue 4/29</h2><p><b>The Story of Data: Visualization,&nbsp; Mapping, and Photography (via Ida)</b></p><p>6pm, <a href='http://www.aperture.org/gallery/'/>Aperture Gallery</a></p><p></p><p>This is part of <a href='http://magnumfoundation.org/photoex/'/>a series of programming</a>&nbsp; put on by the Magnum Foundation to help photographers expend their&nbsp; practice beyond still images.
