<body><h1>Knight foundation-&nbsp;</h1><p>Last month, I wrote this application for Knight foundation prototype fund on a whip with Tega. We are on round two of the application process, we&rsquo;d like to get your feedback on it, as we have phone interview with Chris Barr on friday.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/funding-initiatives/knight-prototype-fund/"></a>http://www.knightfoundation.org/funding-initiatives/knight-prototype-fund/</p><p></p><p>To do&nbsp;</p><ul><li>having high quality video + audio documentation&nbsp;</li>

<p>Tangible Outcome</p><p>Documentation of artist lectures made available</p><p>Code repo</p><p>Publication of course materials</p><p>Remote group of teacher/students who then use these materials throughout the term and provide direct feedback on their engagement with these. From this iterative process we will develop a model of best practice for publishing online courses and engaging remote learning communities.&nbsp;</p><p>Mechanism for feedback from participants.</p><p>existing contents and resource - sfpc.hackpad.com&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Tools for teachers. How do you share the feelings, andedotes etc from class without making extra works for the teacher. We dont want to create another job that someone has to do. Collaborative note taking, archiving etc.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Encoding the video archive. There are no really great tools for documenting and publishing.</p><p></p><p>Low bandwidth audio recordings. Small file. Find a way to build this into the process of teaching.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><b>What is your project?:</b></p><p>The School for Poetic Computation is an independent school located in New York City. It is a 10 week program for artists, designers, writers and engineers to learn programming, electronics as well as theory and history of computing. We support our participants to develop new skills during the production of creative, poetic and educational projects. Our classes are lead both by the school&rsquo;s co-founders as well as new teachers. Our sessions focus on special topics such as esoteric programming languages, environmental sensing and data, and critical theory of technology.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>SFPC Online Open Courses will see the documentation of classes held at the school and make them accessible to remotely located audience. Through these classes students will develop a fundamental understanding of computation through experimentation and collaboration and will explore specific topics such as programming for interactivity, data practices, hardware design and critical approaches to technology. Our project will integrate online learning resources like tutorials and recorded lectures with physical publications and open source hardware kits. These resources will enable new students to learn and share their learning within their community. In this way this project supports new pedagogical approaches for horizontal creative education within a onsite and online learning community.</p><p></p><p><b>What assumptions will you test?:</b></p><p>Our teaching philosophy approaches writing code like writing poetry, creating circuits like building sculptures, collaboration over competition and we encourage each student to pursue their own line of questioning. We are rethinking our pedagogical process for new audiences who are not able to be physically present for our sessions that are held twice a year in New York City. However, this project goes beyond the straight forward publication of the contents of our classes to a digital platform. Rather, we will continue to experiment with and explore new ways to create an intimate and supportive learning environment that fosters collaboration, questioning, experimentation and discussion.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>This project will focus on building strong connections between the virtual and real communities through learning and teaching experiences. It will foster assignment based learning where each remote student will need to engage their local community in their learning process. The course material will help them to understand the concept and tools, and assignments will be a challenge to share their discovery with another local person wherever they are located in the world.</p><p></p><p><b>Who is the audience/user of this project? How will they be impacted?:</b></p><p>Each of our open calls have received 90 - 100 applicants from around the world, including from students living in developing countries who do not have access to national scholarship or a grant systems to study abroad. Currently we charge $5000 tuition for each 10 week program, a fee that only covers the basic cost of running the program including rent, teacher salaries and tools. In the interest of organizational transparency, our past financial records are published online (<a href="https://github.com/SFPC/finance-and-administration)"></a><a href='https://github.com/SFPC/finance-and-administration'/>https://github.com/SFPC/finance-and-administration</a>).&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>With the support of The Knight Foundation&rsquo;s Prototype Fund, we will be able to share the vision of SFPC with many students who can not afford to travel and live in New York City. This grant will enable use to augment our most valuable resource, that of expertise and community with the aim of supporting the development of creative projects that are developed beyond the 10 week program.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>With the &quot;New Audiences&quot; research track in 2014-2015, we anticipate working with youth aged 12-18 who have little or no experience with programming. We choose to work with such youth because an introduction to creative programming and hardware hacking can make a large impact in their academic and professional career.</p><p></p><p><b>Who is on your team?:</b></p><p>The school was founded in 2013 by Zach Lieberman, Taeyoon Choi, Amit Pitaru and Jen Lowe and is based in New York City where it hosts two sessions every year for a total of 40 students. The students often come from professional backgrounds and we specifically search for candidates who are interested in sharing their experience from SFPC after the program.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Taeyoon Choi (project lead) is co-founder of SFPC and served as a teacher for all three semesters of the school. Taeyoon has B.F.A and M.S degree and was a fellow at Eyebeam Art and Technology Center and recipient of Art + Technology Grant from Los Angeles County Museum of Art. He&rsquo;s currently artist in residence at Lower Manhattan Cultural Council and adjunct professor at New York University&rsquo;s Interactive Telecommunication Program. <a href="http://taeyoonchoi.com/"></a><a href='http://taeyoonchoi.com/'/>http://taeyoonchoi.com/</a>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Tega Brain (teacher and SFPC alumni) is an artist, engineer and educator who explores experimental engineering practices, infrastructure and ecology in her work. She was a student in the first SFPC class and has taught in the following sessions of the school. She is a visiting Assistant Professor at SUNY Purchase. <a href="http://tegabrain.com"></a><a href='http://tegabrain.com/'/>http://tegabrain.com</a>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>What have you made so far?:</b></p><p>So far, we&rsquo;ve built a solid community of D.I.Y teachers and students, whose roles are often interchanging depending on the subject matter. We are especially proud of the variety of collaborations that have been birthed at SFPC. Jonathan Wohl and Ishac Bertran, both students from the first class are developing a project called Talking. Others have gone on to initiate experimental collaborative projects at the intersection of art, science and technology like <a href="http://www.specular.cc/"></a><a href='http://www.specular.cc/'/>http://www.specular.cc/</a> and<a href="http://www.hkl.xyz/"></a><a href='http://www.hkl.xyz/'/>http://www.hkl.xyz/</a>. We also invite alumni to join as faculty, Tega Brain and Ida Benedetto are alumni who are now teaching new students. Several alumni have begun their own educational projects like<a href="http://schoolofma.org/"></a><a href='http://schoolofma.org/'/>http://schoolofma.org/</a> and <a href="http://www.ofcourse.io/"></a><a href='http://www.ofcourse.io/'/>http://www.ofcourse.io/</a>.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>We are beginning to create video documentation of lectures and actively publish code.&nbsp;</p><p>Course schedule <a href="https://github.com/SFPC/spring2014"></a><a href='https://github.com/SFPC/spring2014'/>https://github.com/SFPC/spring2014</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Class Syllabus <a href="https://github.com/allisonburtch/Critical-Theory-of-Technology/blob/master/syllabus.md"></a><a href='https://github.com/allisonburtch/Critical-Theory-of-Technology/blob/master/syllabus.md'/>https://github.com/allisonburtch/Critical-Theory-of-Technology/blob/master/syllabus.md</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Code repository <a href="https://github.com/ofZach/algo2012"></a><a href='https://github.com/ofZach/algo2012'/>https://github.com/ofZach/algo2012</a>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The prototype fund of will help us to document the upcoming Spring 2015 semester through a video and code repository and lecture slides with audio recording. The courses will be shared with a select group of students, an international mix of youth and professionals. The participation and feedback from this community will allow us to move toward next step of fully open source education both onsite and online.</p><p></p></body>
