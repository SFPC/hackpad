<body><h1>SFPC Discussion about Education</h1><p></p><ul><li>Creating platform for learning to occur</li>
<li>the philosophy that could be shared, for learning to occur.</li>
<li>About an hour</li>
<li>Propose Questions</li>
<li>Out side of traditional Academy</li>
<li>Ideas of community building.</li>
<li>Teaching at ITP<ul><li>With Zach, 3D sensing class</li>
<li>Been kind of teching alot of 2 credit classes<ul><li>First semester teachching a 12 week class<ul><li>Difference between a free school model and SFPC</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Something are only possible in longer times</li>
<li>Also have done one day workshops<ul><li>6 to 9 hours + lunch</li>
<li>There is different toopics you can teach in these environments</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Something similar to SFPC where poeple are sharing the space and being continously ambient about and other and the space.<ul><li>Teaching code for art program and creative projects.</li>
<li>Started studying art in a grad program.<ul><li>No one knew how to code.</li>
<li>Most where working with editing video andcreating sounscapes.</li>
<li>I felt like I was prepared, once I was in grad school.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Not really what we run into at SFPC, RISD, and ITP<ul><li>SImultaneusly learning about both.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Such a range of backgrounds and skill level.<ul><li>Traditional computer science.</li>
<li>There is a bell curve.</li>
<li>Not the same in an art context.<ul><li>Don&rsquo;t want my students to feel like the fail.</li>
<li>Hard to keep them engaged and challenge.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Hard to expand the range you are teaching to without diluting the teaching. #tip</li>
<li>Technical stress is so incredible.</li>
<li>Fine Art School is meant to be open-ended<ul><li>To have both is quite a challenge.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Questions about the School<ul><li>Who came with strong technical background.</li>
<li>Who came with poetry.</li>
<li>Who came to learn about poetry.</li>
<li>Who came to learn technical skills.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>SFPC Reflections<ul><li>Things we we&rsquo;re struggling with teaching the technology to artistic people.</li>
<li>We got to the computation in someway but how do you teach the poetry.</li>
<li>How do you teach how to make a creative work.</li>
<li>And instigation or provocation.</li>
<li>Succeeded in someway, teaching the technology to artist is one thing but doing the opposite is another.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>When I see something that is beautiful code how do I share that feeling.</li>
<li>Not knowing technical things became a way to learn poetry.<ul><li>Coding thinking is still little bit of a mystery.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Really hard to be reflective when you&rsquo;re doing something.<ul><li>If you don&rsquo;t reflect making the end product might not give a much feedback.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Techincal stuff is not easy to teach.<ul><li>You can give someone the feeling that is easily to learn things.</li>
<li>Understand how to teach themselves further.</li>
<li>COmes down alot to the way that people are dedicated about learning.</li>
<li>THe students apporach about cultivating the right attitute towards learning.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Value in both everyone talking among each other.</li></ul>

<p><b>How do you teach the poetry?</b></p><ul><li>Unaswareable questions that stick with you.<ul><li>Dont happen everday.</li>
<li>Presents a question to you.</li>
<li>Those questions will nag you and stay with you.<ul><li>A situation that is inescaple.</li>
<li>You can&rsquo;t learn about poetry without answaring those questions.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li>You can lear teachnicall things didacttily.</li>
<li>Collaboration is a really good way to learn abou someones processes.<ul><li>Alot of their processes will rub off on you.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Some where between didactic and collaboration.</li>
<li>What is art?<ul><li>What grade do you think you deserve.</li>
<li>Not just about something you show in a classroom is about your commitment its about a full practice.</li>
<li>Not just an artist for a couple of hours.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Run a creq in installation theatrical experiences.<ul><li>Creaitng experiences that connect rdirectly with what it means to be human.</li>
<li>Typologies and true desires about human nature.</li>
<li>Trying to make a tech project with maxMSP that relates to a typology seems to be a pretty good way to get people to start interacting with this stuff.</li>
<li>They start moving away from technology.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Performance Poetry Side<ul><li>360 degree interactive spoken word video.</li>
<li>Teach poeople about poetry.</li>
<li>There are three basic things that I go by.<ul><li>The best word in the best order.</li>
<li>What is the qualitative value.</li>
<li>Rhythm is where the information is.</li>
<li>The medium is the poetry.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>MDR Smith<ul><li>We speak in organic poems.</li>
<li>Its really our job as artist and creators to carve it out of space.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Making poetic things.<ul><li>What does it mean to have Poetics as a goal and how does that affect.</li>
<li>What does it mean to include Pottry in the school.</li>
<li>Really like the complxity of the word and the confusion that it makes.<ul><li>The Poetics of Computation.<ul><li>Something that is not addressed, usually taught a technical thing not a creative medium.</li>
<li>Things that you can do in this medium that are poetic.</li>
<li>Those two things that are never apart.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>What is the value of Poetic computation in the concept of teaching.</li>
<li>The biggest probem that Isaw was not having enough time for students to precesses these things, create space for them to reflect on these things.</li>
<li>Important for part of the name.<ul><li>What is this medium, creative coding.</li>
<li>Around the time for Maedas book.</li>
<li>Where does the word Creative Coding comes from.<ul><li>The creative class, creative city, try to find a new phrase, replace that term.</li>
<li>Trying to describe the medium in a different way.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Did you find that teaching in Poetic Computation was different that teaching at Parsons.<ul><li>Intersection of design and technology with a design curriculum.</li>
<li>Finished thesis in May.&#92;I really did what I wanted to in at SFPC.</li>
<li>So many different classes that you just have to pass.</li>
<li>We use poetic to cover ourselves in to crazy concepts.</li>
<li>We would ask for homework, long list of homework.<ul><li>You can pick just one of them.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>The is no room for homework.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Optional and Dedication conflict.<ul><li>Everyone just being there was enough.</li>
<li>Assignments = Propositions.</li>
<li>What we wanted was selecting students to work with people that we could work with in the future.<ul><li>Creating different ways in which things can be taught.</li>
<li>Mix between an artist residency and a teaching group.</li>
<li>Provide an environment to create work with.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>How the studens can go on with this experience.<ul><li>Spread this method of sharing.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Telling people at the opening taught ten minutes at parsons, when students complaint here I am the administration.<ul><li>Late night ten minute gchats.</li>
<li>Had to evolve as we go.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Will you still go for having different technical levels.<ul><li>How to wrok with skill level differences.</li>
<li>Try a different method and look at the results.</li>
<li>Scheduled time and not scheduled time.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>What to change and what to keep.<ul><li>Started the school with writing questions.</li>
<li>Starting the school not with anwers, led to conversations and discovery.</li>
<li>Writing down ideas earlier.<ul><li>If thats the case there should be more talking about ideas, and then talk about technology about afterwards.</li>
<li>Learning to be artist.</li>
<li>How to become an arttist in a tech medium.</li></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><b>In what ways did not working for grades change the environment?</b></p><ul><li>There was room for failure.</li>
<li>Making everything optional, put the onus on the students to get things out of it.</li>
<li>How to carve out time space in order to go deep on something.</li>
<li>Its good that we were over subscribed we were able to pull out of it the things that were most interesting.</li></ul>
<p><b>What was your best educational experience?</b></p><p><b>Really good moment or favorite class or educational moment?</b></p><p></p><p><b>Guest Speakers</b></p><ul><li>Michael Manderburg<ul><li>Fellow at eyebeam</li>
