<li>Work a lot in processing.<ul><li>A layer on top of Java.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Research is in the name of our company and we want to make sure that we get deep with the data and the way we present it.<ul><li>Try to get someone in the phone that is god with this stuff, put google away.</li>
<li>Is there someone that knows the data set that we can reach out to and have coffee with them.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>We do all this experamentation and prototyping.<ul><li>Have developed this practice not only for art pieces but also sort through complex data problems.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Taking our practice of complicating artworks and using it in other directions.</li>
<li>Its really dangerous to anticipate that their nothing in representing the data in a certain way.</li>
<li>We are always using visualisation as a tool.<ul><li>The data exploration and interrogation phase.</li>
<li>Question farming.<ul><li>We&rsquo;re not really looking for answer, we are looking for better questions.</li></ul>

<li>Instead of visualizing the data, is there a way we can perform it.</li></ul>

<li>The general posture towards big data, even in digital humanities.<ul><li>The basic posture is what question can we ask and get a definitive answer for that.<ul><li>The has its purpose.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>We see something beautiful in the data itself, exploring and walking through it.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>How can we make them useful and not only have be about their utility.</li>
<li>The function for data is to solve things and answer.</li>
<li>We free data to be performed, and shared.</li>
<li>creating a data set to perform.</li>
<li>Everything that was spoken had to be verbatim from the database.</li>
<li>If we did it again we want to focus on capturing the weirdness on these titles.<ul><li>Found an amazing book about all the titles of artwork.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Somethings also come naturally from the data.<ul><li>Counted the first names.<ul><li>The most popular name for an artist in the database is John, and Peter.</li>
<li>Creating a natural resting place.</li>
<li>It took 40 men names before there was a woman name.<ul><li>Tension, trying to get their names into the stream.</li>
<li>I love the idea about data and performance but this sold me the opportunity.</li></ul>

</li>
<li>Having a data make fun of itself.</li>
<li>Having a data critique itself.</li>
<li>There are many ways to look at this data.</li>
<li>This is not a visualization of the data collection, just a subset of that data.</li>
<li>Github</li>
<li>Technical result of MoMA project.</li>
<li>We we&rsquo;re asked to do a 6 month residency at the Museum of Modern Art.</li>
<li>Doing work around their collection archive 20,000 (Session Collection)</li>
<li>Formally in the collection.</li>
<li>Committee created to add to the collection.</li>
<li>What the collection looks like and the form that it was delivered to us.</li>
<li>CVS 102,047 Lines<ul><li>Comma Separated Values<ul><li>Can break machinery that you are trying to feed it into.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Pretty commonly how our work starts.</li>
<li>A data set and off you go.</li>
<li>Hard to navigate this gigantic stream.</li>
<li>Trying to do some work of what the data looks like.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Titles of Artworks are really interesting.<ul><li>They are interesting in what they contain, and what they don&rsquo;t contain.</li>
<li>&quot;Untitled&quot; is the most common tittle.</li>
<li>Sol Lewitt titles are the longest.<ul><li>The title is the instruction and the work.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Specially when dealing with text based data.<ul><li>What are some ways we can easily find patterns through text.</li></ul>

</li>
<li>One of the reasons we want to show this project is to show the tendency that we are not good at doing things the simple way.</li>
<li>Creating a text based timeline.</li>
<li>Produced something very similar to our simple sketches we started with in the white board even though there was so many man hours.</li>
<li>How much work do we do, when do we just let the data take over.<ul><li>Google&rsquo;s operational strategy.<ul><li>Just collect enough data even though not all of it is good.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Most of the work was done through a program we made that sorts the words into specific categories.</li>
<li>One of the challenges about this type of work is foreseeing where this data can take you before we do the work.</li>
<li>Balance between the way we want to explore the data and a client could explore the data.</li>
<li>Picking clients that we are ethically inclined with.</li>
<li>If you build they will come mentality.<ul><li>If you want to make experimental work, show in your portfolio experimental work.</li></ul>

<li>How do you guys deal with Data? <u><a href='https://hackpad.com/ep/search/?q=%23question&amp;via=UxZs316X6tD'/>#question</a></u></li>
<li>There is this perception that data is very neutral, and the institutions who created are mean to be truthful, in reality is selected already. <u><a href='https://hackpad.com/ep/search/?q=%23question&amp;via=UxZs316X6tD'/>#question</a></u></li>
<li>How do you deal with that aspect of it? <a href='https://hackpad.com/ep/search/?q=%23question&amp;via=UxZs316X6tD'/>#question</a></li>
<li>Allan Morris<ul><li>Series of essays for the New York TImes, not a new conclusion, every photograph is a lie.</li>
<li>Photographs its a representation of the event.</li>
<li>By its very existence its biased.</li>
<li>Data is in the same way.</li>
<li>This idea of objectivity in data.<ul><li>I don&rsquo;t think there is objectivity in Data.</li>
<li>To pursue objectivity is falsy.<ul><li>Building a facade.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Saying that a visualization is true and accurate you are lying.</li>
<li>By accepting that its not you embrace, understand and reveal the biases.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Every visualization should have error bars.<ul><li>Users feel uncomfortable with having that data represented, but it a true aspect of the visualization.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li>The whole data world is this last bastion of modernity.<ul><li>Thinking that this data will make the whole world better.</li>
<li>What does post data look like.</li>
<li>Thinking of ways that are not so literal and linear.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Tufte<ul><li>Every pixel in a data visualization has to have a purpose!<ul><li>Really?</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li>What is the smallest dataset you have ever dealt with? <a href='https://hackpad.com/ep/search/?q=%23question&amp;via=UxZs316X6tD'/>#question</a><ul><li>When does it become a pile of information?</li>
<li>Sometime the data set is not big but the story is big.</li>
<li>Using an Avengers comic api.<ul><li>Built of these visualiatoins of the character.</li>
<li>Not a big data set, just a few hundred issues.</li>
<li>If you know the data it can still feel like a big data set.</li>
<li>Data that is not necessarily big can still be visualized in meaning ful ways.<ul><li>To people who knows the story is something more than that.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Data being fractal like.<ul><li>Every data point could open up a new way of representing it.</li></ul>
