<body><h1>Personal Computing History</h1><p></p><p>This is an experimental chronology of my interaction with computers, and possibly a weiiird crash course to start someone else&rsquo;s journey / compare formative years</p><p></p><p><b>History</b></p><p>I&nbsp; started with computers on my Aunts PC, going through WAV files in the&nbsp; wav file recorder, messing around. Then when they got AOL, downloading&nbsp; wav files, and using chat rooms. Chat rooms had robots in them, and it&nbsp; was cool to see what those were. QBASIC came next and then hypercard in&nbsp; high school. Frontpage, then dreamweaver, then arachnaphilia for HTML +&nbsp; CSS.</p><p></p><p>ok this is great start.</p><p></p><p>let&rsquo;s&nbsp; think more about how we can define poetic computation for the next&nbsp; round. esp if 2 weeks, its so short and intense. we can&rsquo;t afford so much&nbsp; time settling in like the last time.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p></body>
