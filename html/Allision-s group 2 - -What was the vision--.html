<body><h1>Allision&rsquo;s group 2 - &quot;What was the vision?&quot;</h1><p></p><p><b>Toru: vision</b></p><p>* similaraties between three readings what facilitate &quot;means&quot; when our technology is becoming more limited (e.g. iphone) vs tech from 80&rsquo;s</p><p>* flower example on page 78</p><p></p><p><b>Lauren: Teaching vision to creators - two challenges</b></p><ol><li>You have to teach how to create:</li></ol>
<p>There are obstacles of getting people involved in tech</p><ul><li>&quot;cultural toxins&quot; of i&rsquo;m a math oriented person or a &rsquo;creative&rsquo; (mindstorms)<ul><li>binary day when EVERYONE said &quot;Ugh i hate math&quot;</li>
<li>Ramsey it&rsquo;s ok, programming sucks - learn basics and build mastery</li></ul>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;people understand what they have experienced&nbsp;<ul><li>having a car, more likely to know how to change a tire</li>
<li><i>I still consider the fundamental fact about learning: Anything is easy if you can assimilate it to your collection of models. If you can&rsquo;t, anything can be pain- fully difficult.</i> (mindstorms)</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Teachers need to be trained and also inspired to teach<ul><li><i>Of course it&rsquo;s (educational CS living up to his vision) taking foreverâ€”because the adults are the intermediaries, and they don&rsquo;t like math and science. (kay)</i></li></ul>
</li>
<li>Goals:&nbsp;<ul><li>provide tools (hardware, software, learning structures) that empower and encourage</li>
<li>consideration to socio-economic background, what needs to be done in different situations</li></ul>
</ul>
<ol><li>You have to teach them what to create:</li></ol>
<p>Teaching tools may not be as important as teaching them to think critically about what they are making with the tools and why</p><ul><li>Kay: computer literacy defined by most schools is too weak - it is how to use basic software like word/ppt. The equivalent of knowing which end of the book is up and how to turn to chapter 3.&nbsp;<ul><li><i>&quot;Literature is first and foremost about having ideas important enough to discuss and write down in some form.&quot;</i></li></ul>
</ul>

<p></p><p><b>Show and tell</b></p><p>Lauren&rsquo;s experiences with a video toaster in the 90&rsquo;s&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ol><li>feeling of mastery over something most grownups felt powerless around made me fearless.&nbsp; allowed me to learn at an accelerated rate through college and most of my career - &rsquo;done it before can do it again&rsquo;</li>
<li>working within a journalistic and collaborative framework taught me how to present a news story vs. an opinion piece - bias, research, multiple pov... responsibility to viewers to be upfront with you intention, not misleading</li></ol>

</ul>

<p></p><p><b>What is your vision of what technology should be?</b></p><ul><li>Toru: using computer is becoming &rsquo;normal&rsquo; (less special) . It&rsquo;s harder to notice the benifit of what computers can do because it is so normal. we have to review the visions of the pioneers again,&nbsp;</li>
<li>lauren: more humanitarian. I&rsquo;d like for there to be more discussion and though put into the benefits and unintended consequences of what we build BEFORE it is built<ul><li>extreme example - Oppenheimer was ambivalent (say his co workers) about the manhattan project and upon the first successful test he simply said &quot;It Worked.&quot; However after the bombing of Nagasaki he (and other co-workers) were very upset and traveled to Washington to <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer'/>hand-deliver</a> a letter to Secretary of War expressing his revulsion and his wish to see nuclear weapons banned.</li>
<li>less extreme - how do i want to measure the success of this thing? after i launch it, how will i measure it? how will i update it to make it more &rsquo;successful&rsquo; and ultimately how can i open source this thing/idea so it can be successful in other places and w/out me?&nbsp;</li></ul>
