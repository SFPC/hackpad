<body><h1>prompt for CUNY event&nbsp;</h1><p>this is an email i got today for this event</p><p><a href="http://centerforthehumanities.org/program/education-periphery-iheap-and-school-poetic-computation-conversation"></a>http://centerforthehumanities.org/program/education-periphery-iheap-and-school-poetic-computation-conversation&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>the prompts are for previous event, but it will be the same questions.</p><p>any help, comment in writing this will be appreciated.</p><p></p><p></p><p><b>Response</b></p><p>work in progress</p><p></p><p>Q: Describe your program, project, or organization.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>A: School for poetic computation is a small school for 15 students that run for 10 weeks in New York City. We teach programming, electronics, critical theory or technology and poetry. Our students come from diverse professional background, gender and age. Our motto is “more poetry, less demo.” We hope to provide an experience that’s somewhere between post-graduate research lab and artist residency.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Q: What is it that you do? What is your goal?</p><p></p><p>A: I’m one of the four co-founders, I’ve been teaching in every semester and also focus on organizing administration and academics. Our shared goal is to create sustainable model for community based around learning and exploring new technology and artistic practice. My personal goal is to continue sharing what I’m passionate about (electronics, performance, storytelling), to a small group of dedicated persons who may or may not be artist.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Q: Why are you doing this? Where did this originate from? Are there particular experiences, texts, people who have inspired you in your endeavor? What are your creative, scholarly or pedagogical influences?</p><p></p><p>A: I’m personally indebted to Goat Island Performance group based in Chicago. They used to run summer school for non-theatrical performance art, with focus on movement and language. I attended a session in 2004 at the tail end of my undergraduate studies at S.A.I.C and the experience completely changed the way I think about pedagogy and collaboration.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The co-founders of SFPC talked about Black Mountain College, Fluxus and Bauhaus as source of inspiration for artist-run school, however they hold less of direct influence. More immediate influences may be coming from our experience of learning and teaching at Masters of Fine Art, Masters of Science programs and being part of creative community such as openFrameworks, Arduino and Eyebeam Art and Technology Center.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Q:Are you working alone, or with others? If others, where did you meet your collaborators and synthesize your interest into action? How does collaboration or individual initiative operate in your structure and play out in the topics your projects address?&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>A: Zach Lieberman, Amit Pitaru and I are the co-founders involved in current program for Fall 2014. We collaborate on academic directions, for example by developing research tracks such as “Assistive technology” and “New audiences.” We also inviting new teachers and visiting artists. Casey Gollan and I work on administration of the school, ranging from finance, public relations and organization. We are very excited to work with new teachers Tega Brain, Ramsey Nasser, Allison Burtch and Ida Benedetto, some of who are alumni of SFPC on classes. We like to try our best to collaborate on administration, admission and day to day operation, but some tasks are centralized to few people for efficiency and clarity.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Q: The liberal arts and the creative arts are under attack for a lot of reasons, one of them being their perceived usefulness to society. Does your program engage the problem/question of utility? Where do your learning environments sit on the spectrum ranging from an art for arts sake or knowledge for knowledge sake approach, to classes engaged in a more instrumentalized or &quot;useful&quot; knowledge?</p><p></p><p>A: I sometimes jokingly say that our school is a ‘Job Dis-Placement Program’, because noticeable number of students decide to abandon their steady jobs as designer or software engineer in large corporations and creative agencies after attending SFPC. Instead of going back to their job, they find freelance opportunities and start their own education programs in varying size and duration. It’s hard to tell what kind of longer term effect our program has on them other than few noticeable cases yet. However I am confident that many students took the opportunity to explore what they are interested in, found one or few others who find it equally interesting, and created a foundation to build their practice. I also think the experience of learning and finding companion is useful to someone’s life, in and outside of traditional academic and work environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In our mission statement, we clearly state we are not interested in teaching technical skills for the sake of utility.</p><p></p><p>“The goal of the school is to promote completely strange, whimsical, and beautiful work – not the sorts of things useful for building a portfolio for finding a job, but the sort of things that will surprise and delight people and help you to keep creating without a job. However, employers tell us they appreciate this kind of work as well.”&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p>Q: What role, if any, does technology play in facilitating your program? Would you be able to do your program in 1970? Why or why not? (This may relate to the next set of questions below.)</p><p></p><p>A: Technology plays a significant role in our program, especially code repository such as github and collaborative writing tool such as hackpad. Every student comes with their personal laptops and the school provide hardware for electronics, projector and speakers and such. I think it would have been possible to run the similar program in the 70’s if there were large financial support. Early days of E.A.T (Experiments in Art and Technology) had a similar spirit, although it was more of salon of artists and engineers. Also the biggest difference is the artists envisions a project and the organization finds resource to realize the project, their roles were clearly divided.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Q: Why now? There seems to be a current growth of these kinds of pedagogical experiments beyond Free Skools, and Freedom Schools. Why is this happening now? Why is it important now?</p><p></p><p>A: I think the idea of small workshops, proto-hackerspaces has been around for a while, especially in the technical communities. I personally see connection and influences of Maker movement, popularity of MOOCs and also growing number of Masters program in Art and Technology, and also market demand on creative technologists. I think our program got a lot of attention at first because of track record of co-founders’ work in art, design, technology and our ambiguous name. We continue to get large number of applicants from all around the world. I think the attraction is now the unique mix of teachers and visiting artists, our location in NYC and the kind of projects that the students create that define the program’s characteristics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p>Q: Is this art?</p><p>A: Maybe. It depends on how you define art.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p><b>email</b></p><p>Hello Everyone,</p><p></p><p>Just sending a reminder to submit your text by Monday, October 20th, in advance of the discussion at CUNY on the 27th.</p><p></p><p>You may write something in response to a set of prompts, which are available here: <a href="http://bit.ly/alted-questions"></a><a href='http://bit.ly/alted-questions'/>http://bit.ly/alted-questions</a>. You do not have to respond these specific prompts and you are free to add your own. Also, you are not obligated to write something new - if there is something you have already written that you would like to use instead, that would likely work. The text should be between 1000-2000 words.</p><p></p><p>Please let me know if you have any questions.</p><p></p><p>Thanks,</p><p></p><p>Anna Harsanyi</p><p></p><p></p><p><b>Educational Outliers: Artist-Run Education or Education as Art?</b></p><p></p><p>Part 1: Thursday 02/12/2015, 2:30pm - 5:00pm</p><p>Mercury Ballroom, 3rd Floor, Hilton New York, 1335 Avenue of the Americas</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p>Part 2: Friday 02/13/2015, 6:30-9:00 PM</p><p>Segal Theatre, The Graduate Center, 365 5th Avenue</p><p></p><p></p><p>ABOUT THE TEXT YOU WILL BE WRITING</p><p></p><p>In preparation for our discussions, you have all agreed to write something about your pedagogical experiment. The goal for this text is two fold: It will help us learn more about each practice, project or organization, and these texts will be published as a way of documenting this workshop, and this phenomenon.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>This writing process builds on my experience organizing panels on this topic over the past 18 months. In particular, this is an extension of a 2013 colloquium (<a href="http://centerforthehumanities.org/seminars/extra-institutional-education)"></a>http://centerforthehumanities.org/seminars/extra-institutional-education) which resulted in an online dossier of similar texts (<a href="http://socialtextjournal.org/periscope_article/educational-outliers/)"></a>http://socialtextjournal.org/periscope_article/educational-outliers/). The key difference in this iteration, is the focus on the arts, and the addition of the questions around artist run education versus education as art.</p><p></p><p>Please consider these prompts below as starting points. You should not feel compelled to answer all of them. You are welcome to add new prompts, or edit existing ones as you see fit. This document’s settings allow anyone to edit.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Please do not include the prompts in your document (like a questionnaire, or interview), but rather write a text that coheres, without the structure of the questions. If you are having trouble with this, start out writing directly in response to the questions, and then I can help you edit the questions out and suture the sections together.</p><p></p><p>You can approach these as case studies, personal narratives, theoretical reflections, poetic expositions, etc. These texts do not need to be overly long, or formal: 1000 to 2000 words is great, though more or less is fine. The most important thing is that you write what you need to write. If you want to make something visual or time based (e.g. slide show or video) that should work, but check in with me.</p><p></p><p>PARTICIPANTS</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Part 1:</b></p><p>Kianga Ford &amp; Shane Aslan Selzer</p><p>Benj Gerdes</p><p>Pablo Helguera,</p><p>Liz Linden &amp; Jen Kennedy</p><p>Gregory Sale</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Part 2:</b></p><p>Beverly Naidus</p><p>Hallie Scott</p><p>Joanna Spitzner</p><p>Caroline Woolard</p><p></p><p>TIMELINE</p><p></p><p>August 15th, prompts sent out</p><p>September 15th, make edits &amp; contributions to the prompts</p><p>December 1st, texts due</p><p>January 5th, collected texts sent out to all participants</p><p>February 12th and 13th, workshop/roundtable</p><p></p><p>WRITING PROMPTS // QUESTIONS AT HAND</p><p></p><p>Describe your program, project, or organization. What is it that you do? What is your goal?&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>I am involved in two projects right now.&nbsp; One is that of&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Why are you doing this? Where did this originate from? Are there particular experiences, texts, people who have inspired you in your endeavor? What are your creative, scholarly or pedagogical influences?</p><p></p><p>Are you working alone, or with others? If others, where did you meet your collaborators and synthesize your interest into action? How does collaboration or individual initiative operate in your structure and play out in the topics your projects address?&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Is the kind of learning that goes on in your learning environment similar to or different from a traditional classroom? If it is different, in what way is it different? Is it different in type, or depth, or subject matter, or...? What kinds of social and cultural formations are possible in a&nbsp; DIY or extra-institutional model that are not possible in a traditional classroom?&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Who is your audience; who participates? In what ways is your program interrogating, transforming or perpetuating the typical audiences for learning.</p><p></p><p>Where does the time and/or money come from? Does your program or project charge a tuition or fee? Who gets paid? Do you have grant or philanthropic backing? Or is this something you do on top of another job that pays the rent? Does the program have an explicit for/non profit philosophy that is important to discuss here?</p><p></p><p>Does your engagement in these pedagogical experiments constitute your primary creative/research practice? Is this your art practice, scholarship, or activist work? Do you teach elsewhere, or is this the only/primary teaching work you do? If you see this work as your art, do you make other art as well? How do you see the boundary or flow between the two? (There is more about education as art below.)</p><p></p><p>Most, if not all, of the projects, programs, and organizations involved in this discussion are non degree granting, and not accredited. Is it important and/or possible for non-accredited, unofficial and transitory programs to challenge/compliment/replace the cultural capital aggregation and discursive community building that lies at the core of the contemporary school? What is the importance of some form of traditional or non-traditional accreditation in this process? Are there examples of inter-oporability, or creative synthesis between traditional and non-traditional programs? Is this an important question?</p><p></p><p>Given that much of the discussion around non traditional learning, (especially the thread coming from Anya Kamenetz’s &quot;Edupunks&quot; book and&nbsp; site,) is rooted in libertarian and neo-liberal critiques of collective social projects, should we be skeptical about these DIY practices? Despite its best intentions, is the DIY movement complicit in a neo-liberal agenda of dismantling the social functions of society, especially including the state university? How do DIY educational projects function in international locations with very different socio-political contexts? For example, how do they play out in relation to the Bologna Process, post-colonial societies or transitional societies?</p><p></p><p>The liberal arts and the creative arts are under attack for a lot of reasons, one of them being their perceived usefulness to society. Does your program engage the problem/question of utility? Where do your learning environments sit on the spectrum ranging from an art for arts sake or knowledge for knowledge sake approach, to classes engaged in a more instrumentalized or &quot;useful&quot; knowledge?</p><p></p><p>What role, if any, does technology play in facilitating your program? Would you be able to do your program in 1970? Why or why not? (This may relate to the next set of questions below.)</p><p></p><p>Why now? There seems to be a current growth of these kinds of pedagogical experiments beyond Free Skools, and Freedom Schools. Why is this happening now? Why is it important now?</p><p></p><p>Why art? Why are so many of these experiments taking place in the arts? Everyone in these two sessions are arts focused. This is partly because it is the theme of the College Art Association conference, but it is also true that I have found that a large share of this round of experiments are arts focused. Is this a result of my own biases, as someone interested in the arts? Or is there something specific about teaching art generally, or about the problems with how art is currently taught, that is more inclined towards these experimental approaches?</p><p></p><p>Is this art? Several of the protagonists I have spoken to clearly articulate their educational work as the core of their art practice, while others strongly reject such a claim, preferring to see their work as artist led education. Artists have pushed at the boundaries of the edges of art, but somehow the proposition that education could be a medium for artmaking provokes strong reactions. Is there something inherently precious about education that precludes it from the domain of art, while all other domains of life and culture are deemed legitimate: the act of walking; the ritual of psychoanalysis; having a conversation; or renovating a house? To echo Claire Bishop: if an educational experience is art, then what is its form? Where is the art?</p><p></p><p>What are the most important questions for you? What has not been asked above?&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p></body>
