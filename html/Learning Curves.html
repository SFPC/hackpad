<li>If we can create an idea that the computer can write</li>
<li>How is a language or concept form the perspective of a language maker even born?</li>
<li>Our understanding of the pattern recognition and wanting to convey that to the machine</li>
<li>Creativity is solely based on the idea of deconstruction and synthesizing of patterns</li>
<li>Explicit to the pattern to the condensity of the pattern</li>
<li>The concept of iteration allows you to enact in computer time</li>
<li>Lets not be as smart as that</li>

<li>What separates us the level through which we are able to take advantage of this.</li>
<li>when talking about variables say set not equal.</li>
<li>Its faster to hop into variables that are similar in size:&nbsp;</li>
<li>In terms of data stored in the computer by being more specific.</li>
<li>Which language fits your character and which ;anguage fits the character your trying to get.</li>
<li>Something cannot equal itself plus ten. y = y + 10; Take the value of y add 10 and set it equal to y</li>
<li>Its evaluating y+10 before it sets y = to y + 10</li>
<li>an iteration structure: decide how many times you want to era rate through a bunch of code.</li>
<li>A language that is easy to write and easy to type.</li>

<li>How much memory did the spaceship had to get to space. Saving a file might have more memory than that these days.</li>
<li>Some that is very explicit and annoying to write move into pattern recognition.</li>
<li>We always need a new variable to expand on the language.</li>
<li>Allows us to take a pattern that is intuitive to us for the machine and and expanding back.</li>
<li>A language that will see your patterns and optimized your code.</li>
<li>A lot of our smartest people are not curing cancer but making javascript faster.</li>
<li>Code using more code using more code using more code</li>
<li>By being able to convey ideas to the algorithm we can move beyond labor to create a certain task.</li>
<li>The algorithm will always allow you to do more things that you could not do brutally</li>
<li>Figure out where the algorithmic part of it is an advantage of it</li>
<li>Classes of computer problems that are computable.</li>
<li>Algorythms and how they relate to your process.</li>
<li>And algorithms that says that if I&rsquo;m here now i should take half the distance where I&rsquo;m supposed to get to.</li>
<li>With creative coding you don&rsquo;t mind fudging it because your not creating a spacecraft.</li>
<li>Not have the vocational idea that we are doing amazing things with computers.</li>
<li>When and where, do we reveal it or not, literacy of understanding computation.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t go into outer space with them produce.</li>
<li>Take this language that you&rsquo;ve written or new one and also one more concept that you choose.</li>
<li>A language that is well rounded needs to consider more than you&rsquo;ve thought about last week.</li>
<li>A recurring chris burden piece that shoots the highest form of AI and shoots it</li>
<li>I think being dismissive of cultures that are growing can create unproductive tensions.</li>
<li>Its the argument of privilege.</li>
<li>Theres a level of intuition and respect to the audience.</li></ul>

<p><b>ClASS 3</b></p><ul><li>Most systems that we divise always hit a wall.</li>
<li>Broad and expressive and not interesting in anyway</li>
<li>What are the limitations of these things and how far can it take me.</li>
<li>Whenever I&rsquo;m learning something new I want to get an overal context.<ul><li>what kind of things have people done with it.</li>
<li>do i invest my time and move forward or not.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>The underlying part of all of this is that there is not such thing as simplification. What is really happening is that they make one thing easy and other things difficult.</li>
<li>Pay attention to how complexity moves, and how it easily happens.</li>
<li>You should figure out if a language is a three year investment.</li>
<li>How much have they gained and internalised certain complexities.<ul><li>In the end they start ooking for other systems that start overlapping with that system,</li></ul>
</li>
<li>The ergonomics of learning,</li>
<li>It defers complexity from me to the computer.</li>

<li>Important 100 things you need to learn once.</li>
<li>Not because the process is complicated but figuring out what to search for.</li>
<li>Books teach you something and then build on their own context.</li>
<li>Weird unintuitive, but totally natural.</li>
<li>You uncomment stuff just to see what breaks.</li>
<li>Sometimes when you don&rsquo;t define somthing they have a default value.</li>
<li>What youre doing is taking the meaning of values, wragling them and creating a meaningful systems.</li>
<li>The kernel, to be able to image how your system intearcts with a number and affec tthe nature of the system without coding it upfront is the nature of the expretise.</li>
<li>Deep systems thinking.</li>
<li>You have to have a mental model of these systems.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t look at this code write it from scratch.</li>
<li>I cannot tell you how many times I written the same code again and again.</li>
<li>Learning to play the piano from a crazy teacher that would throw books at me.</li>
