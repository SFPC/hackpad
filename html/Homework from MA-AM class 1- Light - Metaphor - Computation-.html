<body><h1>Homework from MA/AM class 1: Light + Metaphor + Computation*</h1><p></p><p>Propose new art that connects light - in particular a Blink(1) - to computation, in order to create a metaphor.</p><p></p><p>The light can go anywhere in the world. The computation can be connected to the light in a lot of different ways: the light could show the results of the computation; the light could perform the computation; the light could go off and on at particular threshold values of the computation. Connect the light to computation to create / support your metaphor.</p><p></p><p>Make something to explain your artwork to everyone. Write. Draw. Design. Code. Perform. Slam... it&rsquo;s up to you.</p><p></p><p>*This borrows heavily from Golan Levin&rsquo;s Assignment-03-Blink, which you can read here, though it&rsquo;s not identical to our assignment:</p><p><a href="http://cmuems.com/2013/a/assignments/assignment-03/"></a><a href='http://cmuems.com/2013/a/assignments/assignment-03/'/>http://cmuems.com/2013/a/assignments/assignment-03/</a></p><p></p><p>The Blink(1) light:</p><p><a href="http://thingm.com/products/blink-1.htmlUntitled"></a><a href='http://thingm.com/products/blink-1.html'/>http://thingm.com/products/blink-1.html</a>Untitled</p><p></p><p>This pad text is synchronized as you type, so that everyone viewing this page sees the same text.&nbsp; This allows you to collaborate seamlessly on documents!</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Air quality represented through the simulated life and death of a potted succulent</p><p>(Light lives inside succulent shell)</p><p></p><p><img src='https://hackpad-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/hackpad.com_V0fpKsvHiab_p.77412_1381182237064_air-succulent-CL.png'/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img src='https://hackpad-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/hackpad.com_V0fpKsvHiab_p.77282_1381188635679_url-2.jpg'/></p><p>for detecting the first raindrop in Brooklyn</p><p></p><p><img src='https://hackpad-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/hackpad.com_V0fpKsvHiab_p.77457_1381186753573_undefined'/></p><p></p><p>The metaphor of having an idea represented by a light bulb, which is normally not plugged in.</p><p>This light bulb is a visualisation of a discovery: the light bulb will light up when we discover how to teleport energy.</p><p></p><p>I want the light to represent the stress and nervousness of someone you care about who is physically far away. This will indicate when is the good time to call and show your support and make people feel more connected.</p><p></p><p>The lightbulb as an extra sense: Light color is related to when your friends are thinking of you. If it has to be from actual data, it could aggregate views and comments on social services, the light calls attention to an average value of how much your friends are noticing or thinking about you</p><p></p><p>The color of the light is the sum of the three leds.&nbsp; The red represents the percentage of Americans that identitfy themselves as Republicans, the blue represents the percentage that indeitfy as Democrats, and the green represents the percentage that indentify with the green party.&nbsp; Every time someone shifts their allegiance from one party to another, the light flickers off and then back on again. &rsquo;</p><p></p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sc/qgw95hfnsd144f8/Kerl2JQel3"></a>https://www.dropbox.com/sc/qgw95hfnsd144f8/Kerl2JQel3</p><p>A LED is turn on and off by a speaker</p><p></p><p>The LED lights up when two people are in conversation and not talking about the elephant in the room. / Street lights blink when train is w/in a certain amount of time.</p><p></p><p>Simona: light as highlighter of needed info / idea of *removing* all unneccessary info</p><p>pdf to come: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/g40wc8jdq3gtp3b/Light_Simona.pdf"></a>https://www.dropbox.com/s/g40wc8jdq3gtp3b/Light_Simona.pdf</p><p></p><p><a href="http://berglondon.com/products/svk/"></a>http://berglondon.com/products/svk/</p><p></p><p>Jesse: light to represent faith</p><p></p><p>Jonathan: light to make it more difficult for you to go places you&rsquo;ve already been - light is too bright if you&rsquo;ve been there already - encourages you to go to places you&rsquo;ve already been to</p><p></p><p>red/yellow/green light</p><ul><li>connected to breathalizer (people&rsquo;s response was to game the system by taking more shots)</li>
