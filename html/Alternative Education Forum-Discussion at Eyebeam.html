I can join later also. 4pm ish)<b> Just changed the time so you can join also, Mini!</b></p><p></p><ul><li>Intereting idea of free market of learning</li>
<li>open market university</li>
<li>monetary exchange would be involved</li>
<li>I beam would be good as an accesible public space</li>
<li>free university events, occupy university&nbsp;</li>
<li>David Harvey Sociologist</li>
<li>Experiment in education itself</li>
<li>Friday is the 22</li>
<li>Party before new years, Drink so much that you forget the last year</li>
<li>Whole week of open studio</li>
<li>People might have more experience than we would have</li>
<li>Saturday is a discussion and activities</li>
<li>How were those activities, can we use this model in moving forward</li>
<li>sfpc experience in context of education</li>
<li>workshops would be in the same day 1pm-5pm, discussion starts at 7pm?</li>
<li>Is this making sense?</li>
<li>Everything is somehow related to education.</li>
<li>Exercises that we&rsquo;ve done here in a new context</li>
<li>More as experiments than workshops.</li>
<li>small groups / big groups.</li>
<li>exploring the sizes of groups.</li>
<li>The could be an app be there is so much space for so much more.</li>
<li>Story vs Technology</li>
<li>By running this project we learn something about different teaching methods.</li>
<li>From a guest&rsquo;s point a view they know they are coming into an experimental learning model.</li>
<li>Saturday 6pm the weekend before.</li>
<li>We will be able to use plotter 3d printer etc.</li>
<li>Wednesday we can start using all the space.</li>
<li>Show friday</li>
<li>Saturday workshop</li>
<li>Shouldn&rsquo;t feel like additional work as culmination of the SFPC experience.</li>
<li>Reflect on some of the things that worked here or didn&rsquo;t work here.</li>
<li>Possibly bring the tables?</li>
<li>People could suggest ideas in the first floor and the hackers would make it in the second floor.</li>
<li>Some of the workshop could be fun and whimsical.</li>
<li>Exquisite OpenFrameworks</li>
<li>Making Process ahead of the idea of a polished project.</li>
<li>We can organize projects in process.</li>
<li><a href="http://debugviewart.tumblr.com/"></a>http://debugviewart.tumblr.com/</li>
<li>Can be as compelling as final projects</li>
<li>One think to think about is facilitatin visitors that come in, its right in the middle of chelsea people com in there accidently, what is this building with spraypain on the fron, how do we deal with outsiders, facilitating the guest into the space, important for the days of the wrokshop. Greeting people and showing the work in progress and final projects.</li>
<li>We would be able to tell our story better than others.</li></ul>
