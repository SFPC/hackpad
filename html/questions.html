<body><h1>questions</h1><p></p><p><i>this is from the google drive - please add / organize / augment as you like:&nbsp;</i></p><p></p><p><b>Conceptual</b></p><ul><li>Is the existence/interplay of coherence and incoherence in a piece what makes it interesting?</li>
<li>What is the hardest programming language to be poetic in? The easiest?</li>
<li>Is a computer crash an example of non-media?</li></ul>

<p><b>Political</b></p><ul><li>How do we mitigate risk when creating poems that may get entangled with current power structures?&nbsp;</li>
<li>Do the inventors of the magic lantern, lcd, etc, think about their impact as new media theorists do?&nbsp;</li>

<p><b>Practice</b></p><ul><li>What are good challenges (code, paint, etc) in the format &rsquo;do the same thing in 3 different ways&rsquo;? Are these useful? Like ‘calculate the 256th prime in 3 different languages’</li>
<li>Are there exercises like code katas for fine arts?</li>
