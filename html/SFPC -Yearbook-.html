<body><h1>SFPC &quot;Yearbook&quot;</h1><p></p><p><b>Goals:&nbsp;</b></p><ul><li>To provide a cohesive document (paper/digital) of the students work and what they got out of the program (tools, ideas).&nbsp;</li>
<li>Will be distributed and available at the final event for participants - help provide &rsquo;glue&rsquo; between the displayed works and tie it back to the school and program.</li>
<li>Can be used for prospective students to provide context on what previous participants experienced.</li>
<li>Will be an awesome thing for us to have as well ;-)</li></ul>

<p><b>Questions:</b></p><ul><li>Why did you come to SFPC and what did you hope to accomplish/learn</li>
<li>What are some of the tools/languages you&rsquo;ve learned that you are excited about</li>
<li>What concepts or topics did you learn about here that you want to learn more about</li>
<li>What is the one thing or day that will really stick with you</li>
<li>What is poetic computation?</li>
<li>what are some ideas I started and didn&rsquo;t finish here</li>
<li>what I want to work in over the next 3-6 months&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Small vistories, sewing seeds, asking questions and from the fundamental.</p><p></p></body>
