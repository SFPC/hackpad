<body><h1><b>Shobun&rsquo;s Project Stack</b></h1><p>Using node.js to begin web scraping from prominent art gallery websites in the interest of collecting all of the language used to describe the works exhibited</p><p>Still trying to figure out what is interesting about this idea. It stems a lot from Joshua Simon&rsquo;s writing on &rsquo;Neomaterialism&rsquo; as well as my own interest in the preponderance of trendy materials, largely in sculpture</p><p></p><p>Using HTTrack (a tool used for mirroring websites) to create alternative visual histories.</p><p></p><p>learn about building own pressure sensors to use with arduinos. Interested in making pillows that are linked to external stimuli. They can either play very loud music when there is pressure on them. Or they play intensely propagandistic messages quietly while one is sleeping. The &quot;Guantanamo Line&quot; at Bed, Bath and Beyond.</p><p></p><p>Considering new way to explore flickr images by accessing them spatially based on proximity to US drone strikes (using the Drone Stream API). The idea stems from the rise in sales of anti-anxiety medication in regions where drones were regularly monitoring.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></body>
