<ul style="list-style: none;"><li>are there better systems you can develop for working with code?&nbsp;&nbsp; For identifying questions and understanding?</li></ul>
<ul><li>tell a story using variable names.&nbsp; you code should compile, but also be interesting and evocative to read as text. focus on code as text, can you play with this?&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<ul style="list-style: none;"><li>Look at poems by apollinaire.&nbsp;&nbsp; outrageous examples can be found in the obfuscated code contest (<a href="http://www.ioccc.org/2000/bmeyer.c)"></a>http://www.ioccc.org/2000/bmeyer.c) and also in ishac&rsquo;s code poems:&nbsp;</li>

<li>In my dream the head of a child was in the center.</li>
<li><br/></li>
<li>If the clouds gather on your roof and the rain spares you, will you keep the secret of this double miracle?</li>
<li><br/></li>
<li>But no voice calls you. If you get up, barefoot, you&rsquo;ll get sick. Where would you go, anyway, across these ravines of light.</li>
<li><br/></li>
<li>The quilts keep the silence. Legs folded under, he walks on his wings and goes out. He was an angel and the whiter morning that was rising.</li></ul>

<li>How else could computers be in the world?</li>
<li>What are alternative criteria for computational design?</li>
<li>How could agency be distributed differently in our technological systems?</li></ul>

<p><b>Speculative Design Exercise</b></p><ul><li>Design an alternative GUI for an operating system based on a different set of visual metaphors to that of the desktop</li>
<li>Or, design an operating system that adopts a different set of metaphors based on a system other than that of war/military (ie instead of &quot;execute,&quot; &quot;command line,&quot; etc)</li>
<li>We encourage you to conceive of an alternative history that has led to the development of this alternative computer system. If war was not the driving force, what would there be instead? Does this position computation differently as to its role in our lives, our relationships with computers, our relationships together?</li></ul>
