<body><h1>Bootstrap Curriculum</h1><p></p><p><b>Who is this for?</b></p><p>For anyone curious about programming</p><p>For anyone looking to express themselves in new medium</p><p></p><p><b>What are the end goals?</b></p><p>Students feel confident to break things</p><p>Students are excited (instead of scared) to learn new tools, features, libraries and languages</p><p>Students know they have the support of a huge community, and how to tap into that support</p><p>Students always think &rsquo;I can do this&rsquo; even if they don&rsquo;t know exactly how</p><p></p><p><b>How?</b></p><p>Show inspiration of what can be done with programming, to open possibilities</p><ul class="comment"><li>&nbsp;Probably youtube, but more ideally actual running programs</li></ul>
<p>Start by disarming students fears by playing a game without computers</p><ul class="comment"><li>&nbsp;Avoid questions like &rsquo;what do you want to do&rsquo;&nbsp; because students will probably be unsure of what they can do</li></ul>
<p>Pick an environment that is easy to setup, has a limited vocabulary, and immediate visual feedback</p><p></p><p><b>Resources and Inspiration</b></p><p>Johan did a class where day 1 there was no computers. Instead students played a game where that had to pass commands to each other on pieces of paper, and no ambiguity remained. For example, &quot;Start walking straight. When you see a rock, turn 90 degrees and continue&quot;.</p><ul class="comment"><li>this is kind of like programming walks, algorithmic walking. very interested in this .</li></ul>

<p><b>Feedback from friends</b></p><p>Showing people 3 different tools / 3 different ways to do the same thing so that they are less scared to learn new tools</p><ul class="comment"><li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Can you program?&quot; &quot;I only know javascript&quot; &lt;&lt; KILL THIS THINKING</li></ul>

<p></p><p><b>How to inspire in 1 hour</b></p><p>suggestion</p><p>pls take some time to read literary journal, and see how you can explain, inspire programming, hacking to writers and poets. and vice versa.. as a programmer, what about poetics and aesthetics are you intrigued by? maybe you can get that nailed down, and use as a hook to get more people excited creatively.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://canopycanopycanopy.com/"></a>http://canopycanopycanopy.com/</p><p><a href="http://nplusonemag.com/"></a>http://nplusonemag.com/&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>for two weeks program, we might divide 10 days into 3 sessions, between me, zach and new teachers. what would you rather do: 3 consecutive days, or 4 days over the two weeks period?</p><ul class="comment"><li>I&rsquo;d like to ask the rest of the school which is more interesting - a 3 day intensive where we go from no programming to something interactive</li>
<li>Versus 4 days where people really get to push their progress as they overall have a better understanding of programming</li>
<li>I&nbsp; feel like SFPC first class liked sticking with one mode of thought for a short time rather than context-switching, so I am leaning towards a 3-day</li>
<li>I would love to be available to advise throughout those two weeks</li></ul>
