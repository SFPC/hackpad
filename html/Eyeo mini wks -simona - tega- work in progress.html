<p>^^^ Games for learning/teaching programming - maybe this could be incorporated in the above. So we do a couple of exercises developing games for teaching&nbsp;</p><p>Developing analog pedagogical tools for teaching programming</p><ul><li>binary&nbsp;</li>

<p>2.&nbsp; Eat the data, touch the data</p><p></p><ul style="list-style: none;"><li>This idea came to me when thinking about mine and yours outcome of the school. As final project we both made a sort of physical data visualisation, that aimed to make people &quot;touch&quot; that data combination, think, reflect, ponder about what that data means or feel.</li>
<li><br/></li>
<li>This little workshop encourage participants to think about a way of physically representing data or data combinations.&nbsp;</li>
<li>A provocative/artistic approach to bring focus on the meaning of the data rather than beautiful abstract visualisations.</li>

<p></p><p>Drawing from memory</p><p>We learn and understand complex systems through the mental models that we have developed for them. But what assumptions or misconceptions do we have about the increasingly opaque systems that we use each day?&nbsp;</p><p>In this workshop participants will be asked to draw images of the following processes. a</p><ul><li>the internet?</li>
<li>how an email travels between inboxes</li>
<li>the inside of your computer?</li>
<li>what happens in a transistor?</li></ul>
<p>Over the two sessions of this workshop, the resultant drawings will be become an evolving archive of different personal conceptions of computational systems.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>27.

<p><b>Eat the data, smell the data</b></p><p>This workshop will encourage participants to think about ways of physically representing data or data combinations. How can data be experienced, felt or tasted? How does this experience change how it is understood?&nbsp;</p><p>This workshop will focus on developing provocative/artistic approaches that create an experience relating to the meaning of the data rather than its production as beautiful abstract visualisations.</p><ul style="list-style: none;"><li><br/></li></ul>

<p></p><p>Taste the data, smell the data.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Title: Sense the data&nbsp; (?)&nbsp; (sense is quite used already)</p><p><u>things we said and we should not forget of:</u></p><ul style="list-style: none;"><li>- the vision of this workshop is to have more an open discussion, the approach is to take this time to sit down and think about how we can make experience data, rather than just represent.</li>
<li>- sensorial experience, we talked about structuring the first part of the workshop with a session dedicated at &quot;feelings&quot; and &quot;sensing&quot; we talked about sound and taste or smell as senses we could use.</li>
<li>- we also talked about maybe asking participants to bring along a data set they are passionate about</li></ul>

<p>What is it?</p><p>Most of the times datasets represent a situation, a fact — a snapshot of something that happened. It&rsquo;s almost like taking a picture, but because data is abstract it can be interpreted. And that&rsquo;s where data visualization is now, a visual representation of data, meaning information that has been abstracted in some schematic form.&nbsp;</p><p>But why not involving other senses as well, rather than only sight to represent that data? Why limiting the representation only to a visual artefact?</p><p>How can represents &quot;facts&quot; and &quot;situations&quot; given by a data-set involving more senses? How can me make it &quot;experienceable&quot; or &quot;touchable&quot; ?</p><p>How can we better perceive &quot;that situation&quot; ?</p><p></p><p><u>At this point comes as reference this document I found about Sense-Data from Stanford University:&nbsp;</u></p><p>&quot; Everyone in the philosophy of perception agrees that perception makes us aware of something. Most hold that there is a distinction between the things perception makes us <i>directly</i> aware of, and the things it makes us <i>indirectly</i> aware of, where to be indirectly aware of something is, roughly, to be aware of it in a way that depends on the awareness of something else.&quot;</p><p>Here the link: <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sense-data/#StaCon"></a>http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sense-data/#StaCon</p><p></p><p>Also they talk about Physicalism (although I think it&rsquo;s on a different note):</p><p><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sense-data/#AppPhy"></a>http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sense-data/#AppPhy</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><b>Research</b></p><p>Notes on scent</p><p><a href="http://cabinetmagazine.org/issues/32/jasper_wagner.php"></a>http://cabinetmagazine.org/issues/32/jasper_wagner.php</p><p>Lecture notes on scent taste and touch</p><p><a href="http://www-psych.stanford.edu/~lera/psych115s/notes/lecture11/"></a>http://www-psych.stanford.edu/~lera/psych115s/notes/lecture11/</p><p>Data and smell</p><p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/data-visceralization/370899/"></a><a href='http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/data-visceralization/370899/'/>http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/data-visceralization/370899/</a></p><p></p><p>How do we taste</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste"></a>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste</p><p>Flavour profiles</p><p><a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/cooking-without-recipes-unders-52508"></a>http://www.thekitchn.com/cooking-without-recipes-unders-52508</p><p>Food compounds</p><p><a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/flavor-connection-taste-map-interactive/"></a>http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/flavor-connection-taste-map-interactive/</p><p>Flavour thesaurus (book, I can bring it over)</p><p><a href="http://www.flavourthesaurus.com/"></a>http://www.flavourthesaurus.com/</p><p></p><p>Examples</p><p>Tasty tweets (project from Copenhagen Design Institute)</p><p><a href="http://ciid.dk/education/portfolio/idp12/courses/data-visualisation/projects/tasty-tweets/"></a>http://ciid.dk/education/portfolio/idp12/courses/data-visualisation/projects/tasty-tweets/</p><p></p><p><b>Loose thoughts</b></p><p>making <u>data visceral</u> and not just visible in mind as a design principle</p><p></p><p>making data visceral through multiple sensory channels is a design principle worth exploring as the Internet of Things takes shape.
