<li>How do we talk about Raw Data</li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/brainhouse.braid"></a><a href='http://github.com/brainhouse.braid'/>http://github.com/brainhouse.braid</a><ul><li>Being able to deal really easily with data and import data with different forms.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>I typically use Python as a programming language<ul><li>Flexible</li>
<li>Write web servers</li>
<li>Perverse</li>
<li>Really like making my own libraries and web servers for things.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Think it terms that make sense to you<ul><li>Create you own language of building things.</li>
<li>Lets you make perverse tools</li></ul>
</li>
<li>One thing about sound is that it tends to be expensive.</li>
<li>Sound is less define than other modes of working.</li>
<li>Idea of the School<ul><li>Poetry, interpretation</li>
<li>Artist mandate<ul><li>come up with those things and not let them be define by the raw data.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li>How does it like being in an Academic Situation?<ul><li>Teaching and making art are the stuff I really care about.</li>

</li>
<li>How is the creative environment there? You where at the NY Times R&amp;D Lab and now teaching at school how does it work out?<ul><li>Times was awesome so many resources and facilities but stuck in a certain context.<ul><li>Like a golden chain, you have everything but you&rsquo;re stuck there.</li>
<li>Not doing your own stuff on your own name.</li>
<li>I dont want to disparage any of these modes it just depends on who you are.</li></ul>

</li>
<li>Identity and Data<ul><li>Companies are building Simulcra of us, creating profiles, and figuring contextually what we are about.</li>
<li>Data life is, the more you are wired in the more data is there.</li>
<li>Feeback loop, if you have an interface you have certain options that can also be mined.</li>
<li>Machine Learning in that Loop</li>
<li>Data Science models it from a Behavioral mode.<ul><li>doesn&rsquo;t assume intention.</li>
<li>Interpreted.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>All the behaviors that map to model, terrorist, bussiness man, but you&rsquo;re&nbsp; not doing any of those things.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Does Turning Open Paths changes the places you go to.</li>
<li>Alberto Frigo<ul><li>2004-2040.com<ul><li>His project , every object you interacted with, independent graspable, heuristic.</li>
<li>Every object you interacted with you take a picture.</li>
<li>Eating dinner with him is a funny experience.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>This history of a particular type of interaction in which you see the world.</li>
<li>Creating an archive and not looking for answers and just have it sit as it is.</li>
<li>Move to sweden to archive objects there and change his behavior.</li></ul>

</li>
<li>Those spaces have changed through networks, space that are non-spacial, network spaces.<ul><li>How does that intervene in cyclical time.</li></ul>

<h2>Sound Pieces</h2><ul><li><b>Recording my Rythms Piece</b><ul><li>Sound Artist not a Musician</li>
<li>Capital &quot;M&quot; Music</li>
<li>What is that distinction what is sound what is Music</li>
<li>John Cage deconstructing sound</li>
<li>Dealing with it as an object.</li>
<li>With super colider you start with a synthesis.</li>
<li>Layer of interpretation in music.<ul><li>Rhythms</li>
<li>Pattern</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Music is about everyday life.</li>
<li>Who you are and what you experience is reflected in the types of music you&rsquo;ve create.</li>
<li>You experience everyday life in a certain meter</li>
<li>Recording my:<ul><li>Breathing</li>
<li>Heartrate</li>
<li>Footsteps</li>
<li>Polyrythm</li>
<li>and that changes.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Reperform this data as a musician.</li>
<li>Created an interface kind of like Rockband.</li>
<li>Working at NY R&amp;D Lab</li>
<li>Bedstey =&gt; Timesquare</li>
<li>Fundamental Way in which I relate to the city.</li>
<li>This became a way to document the experience.</li>
<li>What was at stake in that translation from body to data to another body.</li>
<li>Was I true to the data?</li>
<li>Compositional Choice that makes it more readable as music.</li>
<li>Level of interpretation is not any less accurate in a way.</li>
<li>People might not relate to that as music.</li>
<li>We think of data as being objective representing a truth.</li>
<li>How are you measuring it, representing it.</li>
<li>And it has political cultural ramifications.</li></ul>
</li>
<li><b>The Record Project</b><ul><li>Its context awareness, trying to guess results before you even search them.</li>
<li>Moving from data collection to anticipations.</li>
<li>Google tries to inpersonate you to you.</li>
<li>I think everyone should totally make a record out of their own data.</li>
<li>Certainly with this kind of quantified self stuff there are all sorts of dimensions that you record.</li>
<li>Its a question of meaning and want you want to express with it.</li>
<li>There are materials that we can play with as artist coming from a commercial product.</li>
<li>What if I made a record where one rotation was one day, 365 rotatoin was about 11 minutes.<ul><li>1.8 seconds per day</li>
<li>Compressed your daily patterns to that level you can hear this things that repete.</li>
<li>Becomes a musical motif.</li>
<li>Its not a raw data.</li>
<li>Taking out the transportation, only most common and most often.</li>
<li>Assigned a musical interval to each of those.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Cut individual records on a Layth.<ul><li>Its a clock record where you can tell where I am and what time it is.</li>
<li>The physicality of the vinyl became important to me.</li>
<li>Having this tactile and musical relationship with a physical thing.<ul><li>Its still Data so what is at stake when you turn it into analogue.</li>
<li>Data Mining NSA, this same data is understood in corporate significance and monetary value.</li>
<li>Patterns of conformity and nonconformity.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Friendly affective relationship to data.</li>
<li>Haven&rsquo;t sold it yet just showing it around at different places</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t want to separate it from the record (!mp3)</li>
<li>Making it a record is an eclectitable object.</li>
<li>meeblip hardware synths<ul><li>meeblip.com</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li><b>Friends phone Open Path Accident</b><ul><li>Friends phone got stolen but had open path the day before.</li>
<li>Pulled the streatview tiles going on the route of the thief.</li>
<li>Retro-streetview.</li>
<li>Weird Franken Data.</li>
<li>What is this kind of mediation, what does this do.</li>
