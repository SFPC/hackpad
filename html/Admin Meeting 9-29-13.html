<body><h1>Admin Meeting 9/29/13</h1><p></p><p><b>Present:</b> Zach, Jen, Taeyoon, Casey</p><p></p><p><b>School</b></p><ul><li>Classes are going well! Lucky to have this group of students.</li>
<li>First two weeks were like bootcamp. People got sick and didn&rsquo;t have enough time to do homework, but energy was great. Overwhelmed &gt; underwhelmed.</li>
<li>Jen is doing her first dinner class on Thursday: chili.</li>
<li>Taeyoon&rsquo;s classes are going well and he says Amit&rsquo;s are great.</li>
<li>Scheduling shifts:<ul><li>Zach and Taeyoon will both be at sfpc 3 days a week, overlapping.<ul><li>Zach: Mon - Wed</li>
<li>Taeyoon: Wed - Fri</li>
<li>but they might swap from time-to-time</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Casey can do Mondays and at least another full day/day-and-a-half during the week. Flexible but trying to work &lt; 2.5 days /wk this fall b/c of Bruce fellowship.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Format:<ul><li>Do weekly classes make sense for everything being taught?<ul><li>What about doing week-long intensives of one class and then switching gears?&nbsp;<ul><li>Continuity is cool but it&rsquo;s hard to teach that much consecutively, and hard to schedule against day jobs.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Workshops<ul><li>Students are coming up with lists of what they want to learn</li>
<li>Make with Moto workshop was fun, more 2-3 day workshops would be good. Zach will probably teach in workshop format and bring in other teachers where it makes sense.</li>
