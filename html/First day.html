However we started a couple of new initiatives, one of which is to develop programs with partner organizations on providing enrichment and education for youth in the city.

There will be table and wall spaces to show small work in progress. It can be as simple as a laptop or sketchbook. (You can sign up for space here.) We hope this is a fun addition to our low-key social event — you are also welcome to come and just enjoy the party!</p><p></p><undefined><li><b>About SFPC</b></li></undefined>
<p>School for Poetic Computation is organized around exploring the creative and expressive nature of computational approaches to art and design. The school approaches writing code like creative writing — focusing on the mechanics of programming, the demystification of tools, and hacking the conventions of art-making with computation. The school aims to be more than a technical bootcamp. It is an opportunity to work intensively with a small group of students, faculty, and artists to explore questions about the poetics of computation. The school was co-founded by Zachary Lieberman, Taeyoon Choi, Amit Pitaru and Jen Lowe in 2013. The Fall 2014 session is run by Zachary Lieberman, Taeyoon Choi, Amit Pitaru, Tega Brain, Ramsey Nasser, Allison Burtch, and Ida Benedetto.&nbsp;</p><p></p></body>
