<p>ha! interesting. how can you define violence? at what point does force becomes violent? when it starts to hurt? when it&rsquo;s unnecessarily applied?</p><p>related, I can ask what tech they used: <a href="http://ciid.dk/education/portfolio/idp09/courses/performative-design/projects/cop-suit/"></a>http://ciid.dk/education/portfolio/idp09/courses/performative-design/projects/cop-suit/</p><p></p><p></p><p><b>Uncle Harold Teaches God about Control Structures</b></p><p>A story with watercolors that attempts to explain control structures to a pre-adolescent God.</p><p></p><p>initial, incomplete draft: <a href="https://github.com/jmwohl/sfpc/blob/master/Homework/L2L/Uncle%20Harold%20Teaches%20God%20Control%20Structures.md"></a><a href='https://github.com/jmwohl/sfpc/blob/master/Homework/L2L/Uncle%20Harold%20Teaches%20God%20Control%20Structures.md'/>https://github.com/jmwohl/sfpc/blob/master/Homework/L2L/Uncle%20Harold%20Teaches%20God%20Control%20Structures.md</a></p><p></p><p>this is great,</p><p></p><p><b>While you were sleeping...</b></p><p><b>v1</b>.

It reminds me of how some human disease propagates. The ebola virus causes the victim to sneeze as a way of getting air borne and finding new hosts. Its kinda like that - one computer needs to be in the hearing distance of another. But (thinking out loud) the microphone needs to be active I suppose - like maybe during a skype call?</p><p></p><p></p><p><b>Delta</b></p><p>This piece captures all of my incoming personal communications, and acts as a simple counting mechanism.&nbsp; A mobile device displaying the count is placed between the jaws of a small vise, the handle of which is geared down substantially, with the final gear-shaft attached to a winch.&nbsp; Every time an incoming communication arrives, a solenoid fires, ratcheting the winch one notch, effectively tightening the vise<i> ever so slightly.</i>&nbsp; If enough communication arrives, there is a real danger that the vise will crush the device.</p><p></p><p>Reference: <a href="http://www.zwirnerandwirth.com/exhibitions/2004/0904Burden/samson.html"></a><a href='http://www.zwirnerandwirth.com/exhibitions/2004/0904Burden/samson.html'/>http://www.zwirnerandwirth.com/exhibitions/2004/0904Burden/samson.html</a></p><p></p><p><b>Notes:</b> As active members of society, we increasingly depend on screens to navigate our existence.&nbsp; A large portion of our daily communication makes its way to us or is pushed out from us through a screen.&nbsp; It is becoming ever more difficult to spend time away from our screens, for it is through these gleaming portals that we are delivered the scripts by which we enact our lives.</p><p></p><p>Along with so many aspects of contemporary culture, artwork is moving from the enclosed spaces of galleries and museums to the controls of the pixel and the packet. ;) ;)</p><p></p><p></p><p><b>Shoot</b></p><p>A yearly re-enactment of Chris Burden&rsquo;s &rsquo;Shoot.&rsquo;&nbsp; Instead of shooting the artist, use as a stand-in whatever technology is considered to be the pinnacle of artificial intelligence.&nbsp; Continue annually until forced to stop, either by substantial protest or by law.</p><p></p><p>Reference: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE5u3ThYyl4"></a><a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE5u3ThYyl4'/>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE5u3ThYyl4</a></p><p></p><p></p><p><b>Markets</b></p><p>Train a cascade classifier (the technique used to find faces in photos) to find backs of peoples head.&nbsp; Using both the face and back-of-the-head classifiers, show a live feed from a camera in a public space with a heads up display that places ads next to detected faces and a target over backs of heads.</p><p></p><p></p><p><b>Also interested in pursuing / collaborating on:</b></p><ul><li>computer-computer conversations using computer-human gestures (Ishac)</li>
