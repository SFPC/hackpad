He wanted to built the pneumatic transit system after a successful demonstration at the American Institute Fair. He couldn&rsquo;t get the permits, so he applied to do a postal pneumatic system as a bluff so he could start construction.</p><p>It opened in 1870 after 58 days of construction. It only traveled 1 block. Accounts on number of visitors varies, but it was clearly super popular.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><i>The New York Times</i> Â· February 27, 1870</p><p><u>Opening the Bore to Public Inspection--Success of the Undertaking--Great Crowd of Visitors</u></p><p>&quot;Certainly the most novel, if not the most successful, enterprise that New-York has seen for in many a day is the Pneumatic Tunnel under Broadway. A myth, or a humbug, it has hitherto been called by everybody who has been excluded from its interior; but hereafter the incredulous public can have the opportunity of examining the undertaking and judging of its merits. Yesterday the tunnel was thrown open to the inspection of visitors for the first time, and it must be said that every one of them came away surprised and gratified. Such as expected to find a dismal, cavernous retreat under Broadway, opened their eyes at the elegant reception room, the light, airy tunnel and the general appearance of taste and comfort in all the apartments, and those who entered to pick out some scientific flaw in the project, were silenced by the completeness of the machinery, the solidity of the work, and the safety of the running apparatus.&quot; (<a href='http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/Beach_Pneumatic_Transit'/>source</a>)</p><p></p><p><img src='http://images.nycsubway.org/articles/beach-map.jpg'/></p><p></p><p><img src='http://cdn.damninteresting.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/ny_beach_001.gif'/></p><p><img src='http://gajitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/underground-pneumatic-train.jpg'/></p><p></p><p></p><ul style="list-style: none;"><li>After intense lobbying for his once covert project, Beach finally won approval from the mayor to expand his system. Unfortunately, approval coincided with the economic crash of 1873 and the project stopped cold. The station was rediscovered in 1912 when the new BMT subway line began, adjacent to the fully functioning city hall station. Workers burrowed right into the forgotten tunnel. With the forgotten history of New York&rsquo;s first subway rediscovered, a plaque to commemorate Beach&rsquo;s work was ordered to be placed in the City Hall station, but it was never executed on.&nbsp; (<a href='http://www.klaatu.org/klaatu11.html'/>source</a>)</li></ul>

It is at once a simple and elegant solution to gathering trash, and an aging and complicated beast that needs a lot of upkeep.&quot; - <a href='http://www.wired.com/2010/08/trash-sucking-island/all/'/>Wired</a></p><p></p><p>&quot;The AVAC system is the Automated Vacuum Collection System. It was inaugurated in 1975 when the first development on Roosevelt Island opened and today it serves 12,000 inhabitants of the island. Garbage is deposited in a regular building garbage chute, which is gravity-fed, and piles up behind a valve at the bottom. With your average garbage chute, there is a compactor at the bottom that compacts the trash and puts it into bags that are then carried to the curb. Here, there is no compactor â thereâs just a plate and a network of tubes that lead to a facility at the end of the island. Engineers at the facility turn the system on several times a day. It could be automatic, but they often run it manually. The valves open, the garbage drops in and is pulled back to the facility with an air speed of 60 miles per hour (the garbage itself, depending on the density, shoots through at 30-60 miles per hour). A cyclone separator then separates the heavy items from the light, after which a dust collector removes the dust from the air, and the all the garbage and dust drops into a compactor and is condensed into one of 10 containers in the facility that are then picked up by the Department of Sanitation. There are two parallel set-ups, one for the east side of the island and one for the west, which run alternately, and which also provide a redundancy that can act as a back-up if one system has a blockage.&quot; - <a href='http://urbanomnibus.net/2010/05/fast-trash/'/>Urban Omnibus</a>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>We found the control station on the north end of the island.<img src='https://hackpad-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/hackpad.com_aNjhbudg1K9_p.150416_1415760635902_14-11-11SFPCRecess039.JPG'/></p><p></p><p><img src='https://hackpad-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/hackpad.com_aNjhbudg1K9_p.150416_1415760654225_14-11-11SFPCRecess040.JPG'/></p><p><img src='https://hackpad-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/hackpad.com_aNjhbudg1K9_p.150416_1415760672096_14-11-11SFPCRecess042.JPG'/></p><p><img src='https://hackpad-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/hackpad.com_aNjhbudg1K9_p.150416_1415760688051_14-11-11SFPCRecess043.JPG'/></p><p><img src='https://hackpad-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/hackpad.com_aNjhbudg1K9_p.150416_1415760697127_14-11-11SFPCRecess044.JPG'/></p><p></p><p>Roosevelt Island also showed us some signs of it&rsquo;s &rsquo;welfare&rsquo; past.</p><p><img src='https://hackpad-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/hackpad.com_aNjhbudg1K9_p.150416_1415760938128_14-11-11SFPCRecess037.JPG'/></p><p>The 1796 Blackwell House</p><p>In 1829 the city the erection a penitentiary on the island.
