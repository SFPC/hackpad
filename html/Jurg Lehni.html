<li>Its a device that reproduces constantly but always destroys what it has previously drawn.</li>
<li>Installed in a building communicating to the outside world.<ul><li>Proposed to penstacosta in Switzerland.</li>
<li>Installed not how i envisioned.</li>
<li>Other artist could engage width the aesthetic and the possiblities of the device.</li></ul>

<li>Width the idea of it being used outside width spraypaint.</li>
<li>There were alot of engineering challenges and issues of software.</li>
<li>Chalk seemed the complete counterpart to spray, nonpermanent and different association.</li>

<ul><li>Lecture with hector included a competition held in UK about a boat you can build and design in your garage - an open source sailing boat competion. Also an alphabet for blind people.The cantaleiver chair. Sky writing. The motion diagram for hector.<ul><li><br/></li>
<li>Algorythm</li>
<li>Algorythm not a physical installation.</li>
<li>Which pixels need coloring in, if you make it visible it has this strange motion.</li>
<li>C64 was unintentionally unveiling how it works.</li>
<li>Discovered it when I was a child.</li>
<li>These machines set me on a journey.</li>
<li>Personalized them, give them names, have a character and need sort of a carreer as artist.</li>
<li>Finding out about these the machines lives.</li>
<li>Hektor was used from 2002 to 2009.</li>
<li>Have people collaborating and engage in the dialogue about these machines.</li>
<li>Hektor meet William Morris</li>
<li>Industrail production of textiles.</li></ul>

<li>Very earliest test patterns and auto referential.</li>
<li>Started inspiring other people.</li>
<li>Felt protected of this idea.</li>
<li>When it was made there was a eureka sort of component.</li>
<li>Hard for me to accept that other people can make these drawing machines.</li>
<li>Has become a common good, and been featured on craetors projects etc.</li>
<li>Hear opinions of how i think i should feel about it.</li>
<li>Some areas where you discover something where there is a personal attachment of the idea.</li>
<li>The idea is not you the idea is bigger than you and the idea also visits other people. #tip</li>
<li>Scriptographer</li>
<li>Used scriptographer to create software to use with Hektor.</li>
<li>Write the tittle of the show, motion diagram explaining how it would write a text. Rather than doing a service for the museum.</li>
<li>Requires an elastic mind to read this.</li>
<li>Is defunct because CS6 was far too different from the project became paper.js</li></ul>

<li>Wondering if there was a way of automating this.</li>
<li>Allowing to cut through the paper, there was an interface for users to type into it and see it cut.</li>
<li>In return of an artifact that you get to take home you are put through a constraint system.</li>
<li>Produced all this confetti that filled the space.<ul><li>A lot of manual labor which is nice to do sometimes.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Had to slow the machine down in order for it not to break.</li>
<li>Ink Cartridge</li>
<li>Horrible models built in to it to lock you in as a consumer.</li>
<li>Select daily headlines.</li>
<li>Weird shift of authorship, you&rsquo;re not the author of the work your making.</li>
<li>Sustainabiliti is back in fashion.</li>

<li>Predominant company in the creative sector.</li>
<li>Companies providing these static software that allow us to make things.</li>
<li>Computer assisted manual produciton.</li>
<li>If you add automated functionality you can still use your hand as well.</li>
<li>Still working manually but having these existing tools available.</li>
<li>Paper.js</li>
<li>Vector graphics</li>
<li>Works really well for aniamtoin.</li>
<li>Want to turn it into a scripting environment similar to illustrator.</li>
<li>Subtitle Machine</li>
<li>France Festival</li>
<li>Used by film industry to make subtitles.</li>
<li>Allow the subtitle machine to draw on to film.</li>
<li>Draw on existing film and create a second narrative on top of video.</li>
<li>Getting clearance on videos.</li>
<li>Thanks to a transition caused by the advancement of technology we were able to use repurpose industrial hardware.</li>
<li>What drive you more story or technolgy.</li>
<li>Technolgy comes first.</li>
<li>Give things a reason for them to exist.</li>
<li>Still needs a better reason for them to exist.</li>
<li>Archetypes</li>

</li>
<li>Pressure to open source</li>
<li>Piece of work and a platform.</li>
<li>Where do you draw the line.</li>
<li>There is a culture i&rsquo;m also producing.</li>
<li>Very often used as an excuse by creating something.</li>
<li>Just because its open source it becomes a novelty.</li>
<li>Immediate dissemination of culture without history.</li>
<li>If we create this illusion of innovation at an insane speed then everyone feels like an idiot.</li>
<li>Poetic Computation</li>
<li>Anything can be your material, you can cook with simple gradients and this amazing thing happens.</li>
<li>Absolute simple thing, find a gesture and making it visible.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t want the program to do more than it needs to do.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t want to make programs that make things by itself.</li>
<li>Instead something transparent and doesn&rsquo;t scare you.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m nostalgic I just like the transparency of early periods of technology.</li>
<li>Less inspired by a shiny surface that is more of a blackbox.</li>
<li>Making software the doesn&rsquo;t have to have a specific purpose.</li>
<li>There should be a special therapist for technologist.</li></ul>
