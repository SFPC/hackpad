<body><h1>Control Structures Metaphor</h1><p></p><p>Close to the foot of a solitary, snow-capped mountain lies a small, round house. In the kitchen of this house is a person, covered in flour, calmly smashing wheat. His family has grown, and his kids have grown up and they now need sandwiches while apprenticing during the week. So he bakes some bread from the wheat.</p><p></p><p>He wipes sweat off his brow. A sandwich is shared with a friend during break, and she loves the bread so much, she asks for some for herself, and tells all her friends. More is made, word gets out, and soon the father is now known as the village baker.</p><p></p><p>So his wife builds a watermill for him, to help crush all the wheat in support of a now-lucrative dough-powered endeavor. The mill grinds wheat all day and all night long. And the grindstone is so loud it keeps his family up and soon his kids grades are slipping as they takes naps during the day. Bread production actually slows down a bit from the first month, as the constant grating sound of the mill is so bad the father avoids going into the mill to fetch the flour.</p><p></p><p>Staring out the window, up at the mountains in the moonlight, eyes tired from the incessant mill, he stumbles on a solution. The snow on the mountains does nothing at night, but during the day, the suns rays turn it into a fast moving stream as it melts.</p><p></p><p>So the baker-now-engineer starts up the mountain early in the morning, and climbs and climbs until even the mountain goats are far below him. He marks the path of the stream with wooden spikes, right in the middle of the stream every few meters. Satisfied, he makes camp and waits for night fall. By the light of his lantern he starts digging a trench that goes straight to the windmill.</p><p></p><p>He dams the other river that was powering the mill, calls it a night and goes to sleep until morning. Sure enough, the sound of the grindstone is what wakes him in the morning, and the silence a few hours after the sun goes down means the family gets to eat their dinner and head to bed in peace.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>// the trench is a control structure - if-then, the sun is a variable, the river is a boolean statement, the mill an object, grinding the wheat a function. The control structure takes something from the environment and changes when the function executes. The bread is a red herring. The family can sleep now.</p><p></p></body>
