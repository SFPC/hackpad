<body><h1>I want to learn about git!</h1><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Put your name and anything git specific you want to know about:</p><p></p><p>Paige wants to learn about git...I have an account, but that&rsquo;s it!</p><p></p><p>Rachel - I also have an account and know some basic commands in terminal but could use a refresher/best practices kind of lesson. I have the mac client as well but haven&rsquo;t used it, would be cool to see a demo or something.</p><p></p><p>Zan - I want to learn about git, github, and best practices for version control workflow and for hosting.&nbsp; I have an account, and have been using it recently both for version control and gh-pages as a place to host code for live websites.&nbsp; But, I rely on copy/paste more than I should, which means that I end up not checking things in as often as I should :(.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>I know very little!! Please include me.&nbsp; I have an account and the Mac App.</p><p></p><p>Meghana - Got, and have been using github and Mac app for a year or so - but would like to learn more intricacies if we cover it. No specific questions, though.</p><p></p><p>Yuki - I know git just a basic level with add, commit, push and pull to sync data in my two laptops. I&rsquo;d like to know more about useful usages of version controls and collaborations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Nathan â€” Yes Please.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Franc - I&rsquo;ve been using Git for a while, but could use some best practices and specific explanations about rebasing, branching, and everything that falls beyond committing, pushing, pulling, merging. Also, anybody knows about creative uses of version control?</p><ul class="comment"><li>I use branching quite often, and happy to talk about this and also submodules if there&rsquo;s interest.&nbsp;&nbsp; I do most through command line.&nbsp;</li></ul>
