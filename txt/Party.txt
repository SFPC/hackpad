 * Prototype
   * Prototype of a business model.
     * If people want to do it, they can, but we can also work on it and have experience with it.
   * Ideal solution would be to find a VC and a CEO for the project and back away after.
   * Clients can;t really buy and idea that the haven't seen an idea before.
