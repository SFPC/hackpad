PS3 Eye camera with OpenFrameworks

Notes on getting the PS3 Eye camera working with OF:

(note, you do *not* need macam installed, this works on any mac w/ out macam.... just tested) 

 * Download the "Looking for the latest version? maccam-cvs-build-2009-09-25.zip" at the top of this page:
 * http://sourceforge.net/projects/webcam-osx/files/cvs-build/

 * Copy the ".component" file into Macintosh HD/Library/QuickTime

 * Download Jon Wohl's fork of ofxMacamPs3Eye:
 * https://github.com/jmwohl/ofxMacamPs3Eye
 * The pull request for the minor change I made was merged back in to the original repo:
 * https://github.com/paulobarcelos/ofxMacamPs3Eye

 * Add that to your "addons" folder in OpenFrameworks and include this in your project


Using the camera:

 * In the header:
   * #include "ofxMacamPs3Eye.h"
   * in class testApp : public ofBaseApp{}
       * ofxMacamPs3Eye ps3eye;
       * 
    
 * In the cpp:

 *     In setup():
   *     ps3eye.initGrabber(320, 240);
    
 *     In update():
   *     ps3eye.update();
   *     
   *     if (ps3eye.isFrameNew()) {
   *         sourceImage.setFromPixels(ps3eye.getPixels(), ps3eye.getWidth(), ps3eye.getHeight());
   *     }
    ...etc etc...



if you add this code to another project, you might need to make sure .m files compile as objective-c++ not objective-c (had some linking errors otherwise)

After I changed the Type from Objective-C to Objective-C++, I was able to compile it.

Now I have another error, "Field type 'ofxMacamPs3Eye' is an abstract class"

helpful?  http://forum.openframeworks.cc/index.php?topic=10547.0
yes. i'm looking at the same page but don't know where to put the following. 
bool setPixelFormat(ofPixelFormat pixelFormat) { return true;}
ofPixelFormat getPixelFormat() { return OF_PIXELS_MONO;};    
void videoSettings() {}
void setVerbose(bool bTalkToMe) {}        <-this didn't work.
I was able to clear the error, "Field type 'ofxMacamPs3Eye' is an abstract class" by doing this. 
In ofxMacamPs3Eye.h
class ofxMacamPs3Eye : public ofBaseVideoGrabber, public ofBaseVideoDraws {
I removed " : public ofBaseVideoGrabber, public ofBaseVideoDraws"
I got this idea from here
