   * image conversion - http://vectorpoem.com/edscii/#imgconv
 * my own 'bitcoin' (think, research and write out)
   * instead of 1st party or 3rd party cookies, what if we had a 0party cookie on our own devices (computer/phone) that allowed users to submit their 'data' to publishers or networks of their choosing?
   * Why is this needed?
     * 13 - 30% of users are now utilizing ad blocking technology, killing publishers slowly as only large networks can effectively gather enough data to aggregate behaviors and resell as comprehensive profiles to advertisers
     * small/niche publishers have no direct access to advertisers and often have no direct sales, do not get to pitch PRIME $, typically join a network and get aggregate dollars. bottom of barrel as far as agency spend goes - peanuts.
   * What is the benefit?
     * this information would need to be valuable to advertisers & publishers. valid and up-to-date. 
       * option for non personally identifiable or PII - higher reward for PII sharing 
     * publishers and networks would have to incentivize the users to share this information
       * benefit for publishers providing valuable audience to advertisers - trading personal info for content drives publisher to produce quality content to keep that audience
   * how will it work? 
     * technology should be easy for consumers and play in current online ad space
       * cookie based for ad retargeting and plugin based for users
 * language ideas (think, write out & decide)
   * misogyny code translator?
   * crochet language?

   * mixed media (polaroids, crazy quilt, old clothes, paper) *scanned - maybe
   * recipes (food, code & circuits)
   * things i learned in therapy ("future" lauren, the millions of book references my therapist gives me i will probably never read)

Homework
 * Clojure - left off here: http://clojurescriptkoans.com/#conditionals/6 
Zach's - find a new tool, learn it and make something in it.
 * I started with Flixel because I know 'of' it but looking on GitHub I noticed 
   * it hasn't been updated in 3 years and 
   * it is a library so i'd need to use it with a flash development environment like
     * http://alternativeto.net/software/adobe-flash/ or http://stencyl.com/
   * here's a fun tutorial to get started on flixel (if you want to) http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/619388
 * Decided to try 'Construct 2' because it is a game engine that is easy to learn and more current - https://www.scirra.com/construct2

Done-ish

   * write blog post
   * do multiple frames, can it animate?
