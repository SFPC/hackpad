Project ideas
This is a safe pace for listing out ideas, crazy and unfeasible or specific and perfectly executable. Some of these can be in the look for collaboration, or just a mental exercise.

Artish projects
 * Public installation, projections about solitary confinement.
 * Creative uses of git: music, writing, poetry, pattern visuals using git mapping

Workshop ideas
 * A VIM workshop
 * A history of hacking in music
