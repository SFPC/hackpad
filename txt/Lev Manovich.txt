Victor Schklovsky: defamiliarization [ostranenie]  / http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Shklovsky

"The technique of art is to make objects ‘unfamiliar,’ to make forms difficult to increase the difficulty and length of perception because the process of perception is an aesthetic end in itself and must be prolonged." / Art as Technique, 1917

"The “language of poetry is, then, a difficult, roughened, impeded language “ (22) designed
to prolong the act of perception by contrast to the smoothness of prose which is designed
to facilitate comprehension. One can accordingly “define poetry as attenuated, tortuous
speech. Poetic speech is formed speech. Prose is ordinary speech – economical, easy,
proper” (23). There is a disorder to poetry, a “disordering that cannot be predicted” (24).

Ted Underwood's analysis of the development of literary language


Roman Jakobson: the communication functions and poetic functin / http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Jakobson
"Linguistics and Poetics,"" 1960.
http://www.rlwclarke.net/courses/LITS3304/2004-2005/05AJakobsonLinguisticsAndPoetics.pdf
http://www.columbia.edu/itc/visualarts/r4100/jacobson.html
http://individual.utoronto.ca/bmclean/hermeneutics/jakobson_suppl/jakobson_metaphoric_metonymic.htm

Metaphor and metonymy, or selection and combination, are the two basic axes of language and communication. Metaphor is a paradigmatic dimension (vertical, based on selection, substitution and similarity) and metonymy a syntagmatic dimension (horizontal, based on combination, contexture and contiguity).

What makes any verbal message a work of art?’ a work of art is a message in which the poetic or aesthetic function dominates. Poetics deals with the dominance of the poetic function in any form of discourse, poetry or not (e.g. advertising).
The “poetic function projects the principle of equivalence from the axis of selection into the axis of combination” (39).

Another device which is characteristic of poetry is ‘ambiguity.’ This ambiguity is the consequence of the use of tropes by which signs are compared to other signs and as a result of which the exact relationship of signs to their referents is downplayed. Jakobson points out that the “supremacy of poetic function over referential function does not obliterate the reference but makes it ambiguous” (50)
