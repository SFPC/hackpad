Excel Hack Map

Jonathan Dahan asked me to share this visualization I did sometime ago with Excel.

It represents some data (can't say what - sorry) about USA, I created the map entirely in Excel with the long and lat data and making every single cell squared and proportionated.

The process to develop such a map is similar to the one this guy describes in his blog:

Let me know if you are interested in this hand-knitted visualization and would like to know more.

Is there a way to automate the process? or control it programmatically? I know old Excel had some programming macros.. maybe this VBA http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Excel_VBA but not possible to newer versions.. im interested in programming code that commans commercial software. 
 * couldn't you do this via some intermediary format, like CSV?
