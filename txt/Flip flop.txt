Flip flop 
for next class! 
Flip flops store data within the circuit.

*
make a NOT gate with push button by using pull up resistor. 

*


connecting emitter of transistor to ground 

this should have worked with 100k resistor, but better to use 10k 


*
taking that TR 2 out of the way to make it easier to see two transistors crossing each other. 

*
updated circuit simulation.
notice the middle one, the criss cross is 10K, not 100K.
