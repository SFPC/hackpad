Post links to your Tumblr/Flickr/Instagram/Vine/wherever you've been sharing your sfpc photos, videos, and thoughts. I really like the fragmented approach and how everyone has been so proactive about sharing as they learn. I'm going to think about how to aggregate and archive all of action. I bet you guys have lots of ideas about that too.
