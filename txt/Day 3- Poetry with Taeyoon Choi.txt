Assignment [proposition]:
Create a constraint – algorithmic, computational or both – using the following poem:
 * 
 * At Dawn
 * 
 * In my dream the head of a child was in the center.
 * 
 * If the clouds gather on your roof and the rain spares you, will you keep the secret of this double miracle?
 * 
 * But no voice calls you. If you get up, barefoot, you'll get sick. Where would you go, anyway, across these ravines of light.
 * 
 * The quilts keep the silence. Legs folded under, he walks on his wings and goes out. He was an angel and the whiter morning that was rising.
 *
