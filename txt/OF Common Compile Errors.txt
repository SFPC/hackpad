Post Errors here and let's look for common errors to troubleshoot:

While trying to compile ofxVoronoi example file:  
https://github.com/vanderlin/ofxVoronoi
Problem with Compile Utils.cpp


*

TOP 5 problems 
 * set to build openframeworks not the project (target)
   * soluton : be sure to pick the target you are compiling in the top left corner
   * *
 * 64 bit vs 32 bit
   * sometimes it's set to build for 64 bit not 32 bit, you can change this by hightlighting the blue file for the project in the sidebar and adjusting build settings
   * *
 * missing frameworks from older projects
   * older projects (0.8.0 for example) might be missing frameworks needed in newer OF
   * solution-- navigate to system frameworks, right click to say "reveal in finder" and find the missing frameworks (likely coreVideo and qtkit) and drag them into the older project
   * *
 * project in wrong place
   * check if "openframeworks" is red in the sidebar
