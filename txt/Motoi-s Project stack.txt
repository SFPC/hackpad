Motoi's Project stack

All of these ideas are based on playing around with...
 * Learning computer graphics
 * Learning computer vision

 * 100 screen shots everyday 
*

Category
Learning computer graphics

Ideas 
Many screen shots which I took everyday while writing code.
Every screen shot is related to my questions on Questions Programming for Graphics. These screen shots + questions will represent my process of studying computer graphics.

Inspired by Search by Image, Recursively, Transparent PNG, #1. This video consists of a movie of the one day in SFPC, and the similar images of every frame suggested by Google image search algorithm. I wrote a script to generate this video for just my curiosity about what we look like. And then, I was curious about the question "How long does Google take to find the correct images for every frame if I upload all of the original image of these?"

 * This webpage (to be linked to project page) measures that how long Google takes to find the correct images for every frame
 * According to Amit, when he scrolled this page very fast, he could see some similar lines in both columns. I couldn't see the pattern similarity, but probably we can figure this out using computer vision.

 * STARBUCKS Name card (iOS app)

Category
(none)

Ideas
My name is Motoi Shimizu, from Tokyo, Japan.
I like starbucks coffee.
I often go to starbucks to buy a coffee.
And then I get a coffee, and my new starbucks name.

*
Motoy, Motoi, Mothany, Malto....

I don't care if they misspelled my name because they are of course not familiar with my name "Motoi", but it's a bit sad. Through my starbucks experience in Brooklyn, eventually I could understand the reason why some Asian people have their English name. 

The idea of this iOS application is creating your fancy starbucks name to avoid misspelling.

*
(example: Ando - common japanese name >> Andy)

 * Typing your name 
 * Checking your geo location to decide which name list should be used for generating new name
 * Parsing your name to International Phonetic Alphabet
 * Returns the best matching name

Output
iOS App


 * text lighter (iOS app)

Learning Computer graphics? 

Ideas
This idea came up after learning some technics of realtime effect for graphics in glsl.
 * An iOS app for generating a real light effect for the text, which canâ€™t be created programmatically
 * I want to use the real world as an effecter 
 * the next version of my iOS app which I made last year (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62GYZgr3KQg)

*

 * typing text on iOS devices
 * sending svg file of the text shape to RPi
 * drawing the text using XY plotter + LED
 * taking a picture using long exposure
 * sending back the picture to iOS device

Output
 * iOS App


 * TumblrMachine!

 * Definition of the Media Art Pose

*
Something might happens here, let's do the media art pose everyone!

Ideas 
Probably the Media Art Pose might be the common pose for everyone who are interested in the digital art all over the world. When we visited a museum, we found something that looked like a sensor, but nothing happened. And then, some of the people started moving their hands above their heads. The pose and movement of their hand was so familiar. I saw the pose many times in cheesy installations like kinect + projector. 

Making a definition of this hand movement and collecting sample data to create a formula of the movement of your hand will be helpful for making and debugging your application.

Exhibition at Eyebeam is a good chance to collect data.
 * Installing Kinect + screen which looks like something might happen
 * Recording 
 * Calculate the average of the motion

Output
 * (Formula - movement of hand)
 * (Object moving according to the formula)
 * (Recorded Kinect data)

Learning Computer Graphics + optical instrument

Ideas 
Sony VCL-ECU1 (wide converter) is compatible with only Sony 20mm pancake lens. But when I put the wide converter on to Sony MEX-5 55mm lens, I found than it is a nice combination for taking an interesting foggy 
photo even though it was misused. It was really like a real fragment shader.

I want to know what is happening in my lenses.

Output 
 * fragment shader
