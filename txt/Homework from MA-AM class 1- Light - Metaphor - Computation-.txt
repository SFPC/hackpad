Homework from MA/AM class 1: Light + Metaphor + Computation*

Propose new art that connects light - in particular a Blink(1) - to computation, in order to create a metaphor.

The light can go anywhere in the world. The computation can be connected to the light in a lot of different ways: the light could show the results of the computation; the light could perform the computation; the light could go off and on at particular threshold values of the computation. Connect the light to computation to create / support your metaphor.

Make something to explain your artwork to everyone. Write. Draw. Design. Code. Perform. Slam... it's up to you.

The metaphor of having an idea represented by a light bulb, which is normally not plugged in.
This light bulb is a visualisation of a discovery: the light bulb will light up when we discover how to teleport energy.

I want the light to represent the stress and nervousness of someone you care about who is physically far away. This will indicate when is the good time to call and show your support and make people feel more connected.

The lightbulb as an extra sense: Light color is related to when your friends are thinking of you. If it has to be from actual data, it could aggregate views and comments on social services, the light calls attention to an average value of how much your friends are noticing or thinking about you

The color of the light is the sum of the three leds.  The red represents the percentage of Americans that identitfy themselves as Republicans, the blue represents the percentage that indeitfy as Democrats, and the green represents the percentage that indentify with the green party.  Every time someone shifts their allegiance from one party to another, the light flickers off and then back on again. '

Jesse: light to represent faith

Jonathan: light to make it more difficult for you to go places you've already been - light is too bright if you've been there already - encourages you to go to places you've already been to
