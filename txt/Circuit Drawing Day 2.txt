 * How can you get analogue and digital to interface? #question
   * Sometime you want to think with logic and logic operators instead of working with signals.
   * Easier to explain with an oscilloscope.
   * When you are doing analogue output on an arduino you are not really doing analogue output. (PWM)
   * There are functions that you can do in digital that you cant do in analogue.
   * Just because its electronic it doesn't mean its digital. #tip

   * You are able to make a really complex system with a very simple mechanism.
   * The aesthetic of DIY and punk
     * The other endpoint is HD and high end is more aesthetic than artistic.
   * At the end what you want to do with the medium is what matters.

 * made a one bit synthesizers.

Making Lab
 * Public Art festival in Korea

   * Hacker Designer space in Berlin
     * Most well known hardware hacker space .
     * Crazy Tutorials
     * Enjoy doing things simply.
Craft
 * Thinking about knitting and craft.
   * Knitting with conductive fabric.
   * Good for teaching.
     * Kids are good with repetitive tasks once they get into it.
   * A teddy bear that sings to you when going to sleep.

Low Tech
 * More accessible.
 * Somethings wont fail if there is no battery.
 * How can you make it so that a kid can understand it.
 * Audience can become stunned with the technology.

Information and Communication
 * Different ways of encoding informations.
 * Binary is the most efficient for encoding digital information.
 * Logics circuit and flow of electricity.
 * When making a project how is information going to be encoded and how does the user interact with it. #question
 * Levels of abstraction between communication and information.

Super Marion Clouds
*
 * There are two chips on every nintendo one with the artwork and one with the data.
   * Wrote his own application and used his cloud sprite.
   * If you are an engineer you might think this is not hacking.
     * Is it just as strong?
 * Dahan started learning assembler to get into coding on NES.
   * Learn number system to understand how the architecture is.
   * You need to know how each machine works.
   * NES system architecture
     * ROM, RAM, PRG, CHR, CPU, PPU, APU
     * Memory addresses are partioned by hexadecimal.
     * http://www.nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=22&threadid=4291
     * There is no abstraction, "I want to work with this data and this is the interface I can use"
     * 6502 Chip
     * *

 * When someone is designing and creating a new computer do the engineers write in binary and assembly.
   * There are higher level abstractions that can help you.
   * Its also based on other computer architectures.
   * Assembler concatenates files for you.
   * You write the compiler on assembly.
How to Build an Operating System From ScratchNAND to Tetris

   * www.nand2tetris.org/â€Ž
   * Tough and comples
   * There is a hardware level, primitive commands, and math
   * New Arduinos that let you write into the USB
     * Can drop to lower level below arduino.c

 * Laptops with built in FPGAs
 * Lets you write your own CPUs

 * A combination of a resistor and capacitor is called an RC network.
 * People have been building computers based on this book.
 * Taeyoon was trying to build a 4bit computer over the summer.

How did I get into Low Level Electronics
 * You dont need computer science to do that.
 * It was all logic based.
 * Made sense to build it low level.
