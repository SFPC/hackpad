Iron Blogger
In an Iron Blogger challenge, each entrant contributes $10 to the pot. Then whoever manages to blog ... say 5x each week moves on to the next round. Last person standing gets the cash. Wanna play?

Thinking we can start tracking from ... today?   Next week. noo. lets try this week! 

Great challenge, I'll def. be in if it starts next week

 * Try Jekyll http://jekyllrb.com/ Jonas Jongejan

 * Both really cool! Thanks

ohmygod. im not sure if I can do 5x post/ week but i might try... ohhh... or not...ohh maybe..... (Taeyoon)
okay my blog is here and the first posting...  
 *  I'm also not sure if I can do 5x/ week. weekly posting like this first posting might make more sense for me. happy to participate in anyway.. and like Zach D suggested yesterday, maybe we can make a newspaper/ reader where all these postings can be read in one place. 
 * Also if our all have https://disqus.com/ installed, so ppl in different platform can comment and as well, it will be nice 
 * 
 *  Nooooo. Dooooo eeeeet. You can even just post a gif!

 * I'm in - http://www.franc.ly/ and then click on writing (my site is kind of a mess right now, but soon it'll be www.franc.ly/articles)
i'll be posting once a week at http://zachdunham.com/talk - maybe i can referee or something :)
