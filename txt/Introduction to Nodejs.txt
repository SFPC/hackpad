Introduction to Nodejs

examples of using Node.js?
 * www.abug.in/school_for_poetic_computation
    anything with abug.in/xxx translate into sound..?
 * use to mockup api's
 * Dumbrella - proxy service that checks web to see if it's going to rain, communicates this to arduino in an umbrella handle, and lights up the handle if it's going to rain
 * write simple chat bots, twitter bots easily

What is Node.js and why use it?
Python is a  language and interpreter. It's a glue between hardware and software or an interface between networking and a website. It's a platform for building fast networking scalable applications. In Nodejs you are writing javascript code and nodejs runs and interpretes it. It can do many things at once (asynchronys thinking) as apposed to doing things in order A, B, C, etc.

Install node
in terminal, type 
 * brew install nodejs
 * 
Example 1
 * what do each of these examples do?
 *     var http = require('http');
 *     
 *     var send_hello_world = function (req, res) {
 *         res.send('hell world\n');
 *     }
 *     
 *     http.createServer(send_hello_world).listen(1337, '127.0.0.1);
 *     
 *     console.log('Server running at http://127.0.01:1337/');
 *     
Example 2  
 *     my_cool_message_manager.on('message', function(message){
 *         console.log(message);
 *     })
 *     
 *     my_cool_message_manager.on('leave', function(person){
 *         console.log('goodbye, ', person);
 *     }

Example 3 description
-a stream listens for things and pipes them.
-whenever we get a tweet from this twitter stream, print it to the console

Example 3

server.listen (process.env.PORT or 5200), ->
    stream = t.stream 'statuses/filter', { track: keywords }
    
    stream.on 'tweet', (tweet) ->
        for socket in connectSockets
            socket.emit 'tweet', tweet
            
    console.info "[%s] #{server.name} listening at #{server.url}", process.pid

 *  make sure to do `npm install request` before running this
 * but how do i install npm?

Node.js on the raspberry pi
Node on the raspbian (the default raspberry pi linux distribution), is really, really out of date. To get an up-to-date version, install from these sources (thanks revryl ):

 * wget http://node-arm.herokuapp.com/node_latest_armhf.deb
 * sudo dpkg -i node_latest_armhf.deb
