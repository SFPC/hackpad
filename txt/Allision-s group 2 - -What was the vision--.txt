Allision's group 2 - "What was the vision?"

Toru: vision
* similaraties between three readings what facilitate "means" when our technology is becoming more limited (e.g. iphone) vs tech from 80's
* flower example on page 78

Lauren: Teaching vision to creators - two challenges
 * You have to teach how to create:
There are obstacles of getting people involved in tech
   * "cultural toxins" of i'm a math oriented person or a 'creative' (mindstorms)
     * binary day when EVERYONE said "Ugh i hate math"
     * Ramsey it's ok, programming sucks - learn basics and build mastery
   *  people understand what they have experienced 
     * having a car, more likely to know how to change a tire
     * I still consider the fundamental fact about learning: Anything is easy if you can assimilate it to your collection of models. If you can't, anything can be pain- fully difficult. (mindstorms)
   * Teachers need to be trained and also inspired to teach
     * Of course it's (educational CS living up to his vision) taking foreverâ€”because the adults are the intermediaries, and they don't like math and science. (kay)
   * Goals: 
     * provide tools (hardware, software, learning structures) that empower and encourage
     * consideration to socio-economic background, what needs to be done in different situations
 * You have to teach them what to create:
Teaching tools may not be as important as teaching them to think critically about what they are making with the tools and why
   * Kay: computer literacy defined by most schools is too weak - it is how to use basic software like word/ppt. The equivalent of knowing which end of the book is up and how to turn to chapter 3. 
     * "Literature is first and foremost about having ideas important enough to discuss and write down in some form."


Show and tell
Lauren's experiences with a video toaster in the 90's  
 * feeling of mastery over something most grownups felt powerless around made me fearless.  allowed me to learn at an accelerated rate through college and most of my career - 'done it before can do it again'
 * working within a journalistic and collaborative framework taught me how to present a news story vs. an opinion piece - bias, research, multiple pov... responsibility to viewers to be upfront with you intention, not misleading

* did this steep learning curve help us feel more comfortable with technology then kids who grow up w imovie or an ipad music maker (look at those buttons on mario paint)
 * reference andrew's blog - tendency to focus on the newest tech 
   * or go in blindly w/out thinking of desired outcome (Alan Kay) "But I think the big problem is that schools have very few ideas about what to do with the computers once the kids have them."


What is your vision of what technology should be?
 * Toru: using computer is becoming 'normal' (less special) . It's harder to notice the benifit of what computers can do because it is so normal. we have to review the visions of the pioneers again, 
 * lauren: more humanitarian. I'd like for there to be more discussion and though put into the benefits and unintended consequences of what we build BEFORE it is built
   * extreme example - Oppenheimer was ambivalent (say his co workers) about the manhattan project and upon the first successful test he simply said "It Worked." However after the bombing of Nagasaki he (and other co-workers) were very upset and traveled to Washington to hand-deliver a letter to Secretary of War expressing his revulsion and his wish to see nuclear weapons banned.
   * less extreme - how do i want to measure the success of this thing? after i launch it, how will i measure it? how will i update it to make it more 'successful' and ultimately how can i open source this thing/idea so it can be successful in other places and w/out me? 
Todd: it's a driverless car. it's a 'providing content tool'
