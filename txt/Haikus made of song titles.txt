Haikus made of song titles
Goal: Create a haiku generator using a song title library.

Prototyping how it will look:
1. Click on generate a new haiku and write your name
*
2. Then the page will show you a haiku made of title songs, and the author of each song.
*

3. Go to the archive to see another haikus!.
*

Questions:
Should the page show you the tags used in the haiku? This information is meaningful?
Should the page allow you to write the first title song to start?
