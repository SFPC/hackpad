Personal Computing History

This is an experimental chronology of my interaction with computers, and possibly a weiiird crash course to start someone else's journey / compare formative years

History
I  started with computers on my Aunts PC, going through WAV files in the  wav file recorder, messing around. Then when they got AOL, downloading  wav files, and using chat rooms. Chat rooms had robots in them, and it  was cool to see what those were. QBASIC came next and then hypercard in  high school. Frontpage, then dreamweaver, then arachnaphilia for HTML +  CSS.

ok this is great start.

let's  think more about how we can define poetic computation for the next  round. esp if 2 weeks, its so short and intense. we can't afford so much  time settling in like the last time.
