SFPC Fall 2014 Welcome Pack
(survival guide)

Class Documentation

We really like to use a shared document platform called HackPad. This is a platform where you can share information, document work and generally see what is going on at the school. During classes we’ve found it to be great for few people to take notes into a group hackpad on behalf of everyone. This also allows those who might not be physically present to see what is happening online.

SFPC flickr repository is here:

Please contribute your photos to one of the organizers and we would love to share them here.

Communications

Email. There are several group email addresses that can be used to contact the different groups at SFPC. These are:

 * 2014 SFPC Fall list : fall14@lists.sfpc.io 
 * The entire SFPC community of past students and teachers: sfpc_school@lists.sfpc.io
 * Teachers can be emailed as a group at teachers@sfpc.io
 * Individual teachers emails are (zach@sfpc.io, taeyoon@sfpc.io, casey@sfpc.io, tega@sfpc.io, ramsey@sfpc.io, allison@sfpc.io, ida@sfpc.io, amit@sfpc.io)
 * info@sfpc.io is the general email and reaches Casey / Taeyoon / Zach and is used for more external communication. 

Please use the mailing list for questions / ideas / comments etc.  Things that are happening around the city, self organizing, etc.  Consider email a good medium for time delayed responses or one to many communication.  We will also be using Slack, which is similar to IRC, which is useful for more immediate  things, and hackpad, which is good for collective documentation.   In addition, there's an email list / slack for orbital, but we'll try to filter relevant information to you.

In the case of emergencies, the organizers and building manager contacts are at the end of this document.

Using the Orbital Space

The Orbital building is a co-working space run by Gary Chou (see contact list). We are very lucky that SFPC has the run of the entire 4th floor.   You have 24 hour access to this space during the 10 week term. The 2nd and 3rd floors are occupied by other Orbital members. Please be respectful that these folks who are working and using the facilities of the building too.   Also, feel free to introduce yourself if appropriate and get to know the folks in the space, they are really quite nice.  

Orbital 101

 * (From Gary)
 * 
 * It's a living document, and we'll likely need to augment and adjust as we go along.
 * 
 * If you have any questions, please email help@orbitalnyc.com and you'll likely get a quicker answer.  The folks on help@ are also cc:ed above and they've been helping me run the space.  They are all super nice.
 * 
 * It is a real honor to have y'all here at Orbital. 


Lower East Side Survival Guide

SFPC is located in NYC’s lower east side and right next to Chinatown. The nearest subway stop is Delancy/Essex St station. The cheapest way to get around is to buy all-you-can-travel subway passes ($30 unlimited weekly pass, $110ish for an unlimited monthly subway pass).

Citibike is a bike sharing program that costs 100$ / yr -- it might not make sense for 10 weeks, but it's a very useful system for getting around the city and there's a citibike location quite close to orbital.  

We’ve put together a google map that you can add to for details of good spots to eat, drink and visit. SFPC
