Things I want to learn:
Physics engine stuff: collision detection
Algorithms - Voronoi, Delunay, Circle packing, etc.
Sound design
Projection mapping with objects (https://vimeo.com/67724509)
Better ways of documenting my projects

Questions I have/things I don't understand/things that make me (╯°□°）╯︵  ┻━┻):
 * I don't really understand model/view/projection matrices here
 * how indices work/how to use them in oF
 * I feel like I can use perlin noise, but I don't understand the perlin noise 'octaves' ???
         * Thanks to Zachary Dunham for helping me on this one!

 * in Zach's algo2012/week4/bounceOffTheWalls: virtual ~particle(){};  
I think this is a particle destructor? I'm not sure what the virtual keyword means yet. I also don't see this being called in the code...  is it necessary to have a destructor in the class definition? Whenever we click the mouse is it just resetting properties of the existing particles?
 * ~ is a destructor.  We don't really do anything here, so we don't need to write it (If we don't write it, the compiler writes an empty one for us).   When the mouse clicks it's making new particles.
 * (Ask me about "virtual" later...)
What is the difference between calling a destructor and pop_back()? http://forum.openframeworks.cc/t/vectors-and-memory-leaks/11552/2
 * can you email this question (and above qs?) it's a bit easier to answer via email 

 * I think I understand what a mesh is but I don't understand what's happening with vbos/vboMesh and how it's different/extends ofMesh?

 * Unnumbered Sparks - Aaron Koblin + Janet Echelman
 * John Brown started a project called Uncontext - I think it's kind of cool/interesting to have this source/stream of data removed from context. Ambiguity with some constraint (in this case the type of data returned) is exciting and I'd recommend looking at some of the examples! Only John knows where the data is coming from, and the only hint(?) is that this first round is called "Literature."

ideas, thought fleet + brain dumps, temporary, unfinished:
 * human body as natural landscape - mountainous, rugged, terrain, soft, desert
 * the (in)significance of (a) being
   * multiverse, mirrors, macro and micro 
   * introspection, navelgazers
   * "we are a way for the cosmos to know itself"
   * (How) Could I simulate exploring other galaxies, planets (finding life on other planets, each with their own creatures exhibiting different behaviors?) (How) Could I move this from 2D to 3D? Is this an impossible endeavor?!
 * deep sea gigantism 
 * teratology
   * Misako Inaoka (shared by Andrew)
 * I was inspired by an exercise I went through for a screenwriting class I took four years ago: write a story based on a picture. There could be a website for aspiring authors/writing short stories or poems based on an "image of the week" or something like that. The website can show a random photo (possibly a flickr feed) or a user can curate their own set of photos, like a storyboard. Website might have a built in text editor. People can publish stories anonymously. Could potentially be for both writers to submit stories, and also for photographers to submit their photos. People can '<3' stories.
==========================================
I told Miyazaki I love the “gratuitous motion” in his films; instead of every movement being dictated by the story, sometimes people will just sit for a moment, or they will sigh, or look in a running stream, or do something extra, not to advance the story but only to give the sense of time and place and who they are.

"We have a word for that in Japanese," he said. "It’s called ma. Emptiness. It’s there intentionally."

Is that like the “pillow words” that separate phrases in Japanese poetry?
"I don’t think it’s like the pillow word." He clapped his hands three or four times. "The time in between my clapping is ma. If you just have non-stop action with no breathing space at all, it’s just busyness, But if you take a moment, then the tension building in the film can grow into a wider dimension. If you just have constant tension at 80 degrees all the time you just get numb." 

Rogert Ebert, on Hayao Miyazaki
