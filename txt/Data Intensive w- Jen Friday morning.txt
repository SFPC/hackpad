Mini - data soon to come

As an example I would like to go over how to connect to a API like this one: https://developer.forecast.io/
I know that there is a python wrapper to do this here: https://github.com/ZeevG/python-forcast.io BUT here are my questions regarding its use, first of all:
 * what is a wrapper? when should I go out looking for one?
 * From the python wrapper documentation they say "Requests is now used for HTTP/S requests. The main advantages are HTTPS support and GZip compression" - what does this mean?
 * "You can now use pip to install python-forecastio." what is pip - what does it do - the documentation says it manages python packages? I guess I install it in the terminal?
 * Once I have a python script bringing in the data, how can I pipe it to Processing or OF to use? Got any examples of this?
 * Anything else about going about using a web API like this? Basic things to look out for? Steps? Tricks etc.? 
   * here's how to load and parse in OF / ofx json: http://pastebin.com/Jr8RdZZD
   * in ofxJson, use a combination of [""] and [] to access elements, [""] for getting the values of a key, and [] for accessing an array.  arrays have .size() function also which is useful.
