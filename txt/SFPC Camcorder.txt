SFPC Camcorder
Taeyoon is working on figuring out easy workflow for Canon video camera. We are hoping to make an easy way of recording, archiving and sharing lecture and event videos and photos. 

so far it's pretty annoying.

one file is larger than 5gb, and won't transfer back to sd card after unpacking from AVCHD.


working on downloading videos from SD card and camera's internal memory into SFPC's new mac mini- which actually belongs to Gary. 

 * This is a very useful tool for encoding / batch encoding: https://handbrake.fr/    

 * one option to try: selecting video quality so the files are smaller
 * audio quality
 *  is bad; connecting microphone to the camcorder" 
   * using Blue mic- usb or mini cable - - probably needs to be powered by USB and then connects to the camera over mini cable. - meed to get really long mini cable. also need to get audio monitoring headset 
     * isn't the blue mic just for computers / streaming? 
   * wireless mic would be useful I think

 * (I have one of these if you want to test) . as I recall they record *very* big / raw files however -- I'm not sure this is ideal.   I don't remember alot of compression options on capture and also the system can be a bit finicky (it doesn't really detect format problems and just shows black if the camera is giving an incompatible format.  I usually have to use a TV to adjust settings on a camera w/ this recorder).  
 * getting few extra SD cards will be helpful for now. we have to manually download and uncompress large avchd files and move to mac mini.. still looking for better solution. 

ok that with Thunderbolt camera will be good mix.

what software should we use to record HD video on mac mini?
maybe we just need a set top box 

Blackmagic has a built in software for recording, alternative blackmagic to syphon -> syphon recorder
*

Ok. the mac mini is set up.
you can connect to it. it's called SFPCmini

if you need id and password, try SFPCteam as ID and sfpc as password.
there are some video files on the foler sfpc videos. video of the presentation from the first day are still in my computer.
