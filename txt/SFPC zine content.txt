School for Poetic Computation is a small artist-led school for studying computation through hands-on workshops and conceptual investigation. The Spring 2014 session ran for two weeks at Orbital, 155 Rivington Street, NYC between April 20 and May 4.

The two week intensive was organized by SFPC co-founders Zach Lieberman and Taeyoon Choi along with Casey Gollan, and SFPC alumni Jonathan Dahan and Tega Brain. Teachers led classes on programming, hardware hacking, poetry, and many more topics based on participants' interests. They were also available to support participants through individual tutoring and collective brainstorming.

Additionally, classes by Gabriella Levine, Kaho Abe, Lauren McCarthy, and Kyle McDonald provided opportunities to dive into specific methods of working with computation in unusual ways.

Special guests who joined students for lunch presentations or workshops included: Lev Manovich, Becky Stern, Jer Thorp, Ben Rubin, Sean McIntyre, Masa Kawamura, Qanta Shimizu, and Kenneth Goldsmith, .

SFPC is planning another 10 weeks session starting in September, 2014.  

150 copies of this zine were produced to celebrate final day on May 4th, and other material including class notes, participants' projects and documentation were made available through local file sharing using occupy.here.
