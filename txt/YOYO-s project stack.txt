*Technical question
 * learn openGL and shader language
 * -http://glsl.heroku.com/e#15037.0 (this web site provides cool stuff for glsl fragment shader code)
 * -http://www.openframeworks.cc/tutorials/graphics/shaders.html (basic lecture for glsl)
 * -http://www.cs.unh.edu/~cs770/docs/glsl-1.20-quickref.pdf (quick reference of GLSL)
 * -https://github.com/jasonlevine/glsl-workshop (examples that Jason,sfpc alumni,made for glsl workshop)
 * http://wgld.org/d/webgl/w044.html (japanese page)
 * how to use FBO
 * -I have been trying to put video input to sphere in GLSL.
 * my code seems somthing working now but it is not really going well.
 * 
 * how to set up xbee on arduino
 * -I want to make wirless sensor network for sending data to oF. 
 * how to send signal from openframeworks to Max
 * 
 * how to use arduino from openframeworks
 * -I want to use sensors to reflect my animetion on oF project. it is like 3D motion sensor to move box in screen.
 * -Firm hlped me with this. 
 * -https://github.com/firmread/ofArduinoExamples (this is very simplified example that firm made for easily use arduino with oF.)
 * aggressively tick that out for you since we did do this together :P
 * it worked well. thanks!
 * Audio analysis
   * there is better addon to do this?
   * or better Algorithm?
 * can you also share some conceptual/ design/ story oriented questions here too? thanks
 * yes of course,I am trying to relate these technical questions to my project I am working on 


Audio input to change (generate) Shapes in oF
idea
audio analysis https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhUS2EZbj6g

things to use for this project
 * openframeworks(for graphic)
   * addons
     * shader
necessary knowledge, question
 * GLSL
 * how to make shapes with oF?
 * how to analysis sound.?
   * there are better audo analysis addons for openframeworks or external softwares?
input
 * audio input (built-in maicrophone?)
output
 * graphic
   * when sound of lavel changes, shapes get bigger.
   * when sound of tone changes, types of shapes and color change.


Google Street Sound
Walk around in NYC with sound (by controling with 3d accelerator)
idea 
I think that the sound in NYC is characteristic to me. I mean there are sounds of taxi, people talking, subway.....
I always imagine that I can walk around with characteristic sound in NY
*

1 record sound in NYC with location data
2 put sound data to oF project
3 explore NYC by controling the device which sends location
4 you can hear any sounds depending on your location.

things to use for this project
it's kind of similar to previous project.
 * openframeworks
 * arduino?
necessary knowledge to get done this work and questions
 * how to record sounds including location data
input
 * iphone(accelerometer)
 * arduino(accelerometer)
output
 * sound from iphone
