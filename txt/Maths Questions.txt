Maths Questions

"I like THIS kind of stuff: how is it made???" (Homework)
Who knows what??? (Homework)

GENERAL
All Hackpad Everything
What maths do you use most in the work you do?
What is the most interesting equation of all time?
 * how to turn an algorithm into a piece of code +2 ❤ 
   * more specifically, how to "read" a math paper and turn it into code +1

what math that i don't know about would be interesting to learn about
 * the reason why we should learn mathematics
 * how many symbols should I memorize



Matrices +1

The mathematics of sound +2 (Jason help answer this)
 * remind me to bring in the musicmathics books (http://www.musimathics.com/)


Pi, sin, cos, tan-- what are they exactly and how can they be useful? how do they behave for - animations, music, ...+1  (Jason help answer this)
3D math-- vertices, how are shaders calculated, etc. +2
FFT




VISUALISATION
useful statistics for data visualizations +2  (and statistics for dealing with data in general)
   * useful math from parsing data (data analysis)+1 +1
Working and visualising more than 3 dimensions. Cases when this is needed.
matrix math/is it even useful (and how) +2 ❤ :) :P (A: Its really important for 3D graphics tranformations and image processing)
I think it's useful for testing several arrays against each other - maybe we can talk about this in relation to evatuated/ordering/working with large datasets? +1
understanding math notation and turning it into code/algorithm +1



Best way to model object behaviors and dynamic interactions between those
Finding hovers and intersections in geometry (in code)
Beautiful unsolved problems

Vector math +2

How to count many numbers at the same time? (count going up and down) 

How to calculate the area created by points? Integrals + Convex Hull I think

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
Simple AI for games +2 
 * pathfinding can be done with A*
 * check out super mario ai contest
Simple AI for shooting and fighting games

LIFE AND GENERATIVE TYPE MATHS?
Can we get an ant farm ? Goats? Cheese? Microbes? Talk about algorithms in these life forms? +1  
 *  (as a side note, see http://www.creativeapplications.net/processing/debug-openframeworks-processing/ for interesting bug / tracking / output system)

 * hydrodynamics/fluid dynamics/drawing marble
 * reaction/ diffusion equations
Collective Intelligence algorithms

Flocking Algorithms +4
physics engines/physics simulations
Kinetics/Kinetic energy?

 * collective intelligence / how to make amazon suggesting system
 * lighting / shading
 * Can we talk about markov chains (Le can help)
 * What is a quaternion? How do we control cameras
 * K-nearest-neighbor and other clustering algorithms?
   * also SVD, other dimension reduction techniques
 * What the heck are eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and what are they good for?
 * lens aberration correction

LIGHTING AND ENVIRONMENTS
The math behind lighting calculations
The mathematics of light !


 * How do curve algorithms work?  What different types of curves are there? +10

Where do you get good data?
How do you know if it is good data?
What can we do to tell?
How do you statistically 'clean up' data?
