I want to learn:                                                                                                                  


 * how to get openframeworks for iOS up and running -- hopefully this will happen soon-- before your class but just thought i'd mention it in case someone can help with this. (still looking for an update to the simulator!)
 * are there things we should know about the difference between oF for mac and iOS?
 * how to setup UI elements-- i take it it doesnt use an .xib file or storyboards as with standard cocoa framework?
 * how to integrate oF with standard iOS app using cocoa framework (combining obj.c & c++)

Shortcuts for all of the code signing and certificates for iOS development devices
(andy-- i think this is standard ie. not particular to oF-- we can talk about it tomorrow:)
