BASIC DESCRIPTION

The Hacktory, Philadelphiaâ€™s first hackerspace for hackers and artists, announces its inaugural Unknown Territory Fellowship and Artist-in-Residency. There are two different programs. Both programs offer the opportunity to learn and explore at the edges of technology and art, literally in unchartered territory, to create new experiences and new possibilities with code, hardware and creative expression.

The Unknown Territory Fellowship seeks established artists working with software and electronics worldwide. Selected fellows focus on a specific project or avenue to explore in their work during a period of 2-4 weeks of continuous onsite activity in Philadelphia, and make use of the resources and knowledge base at The Hacktory. In addition to working on a specific project, fellows teach workshops and lead programs about their work.
