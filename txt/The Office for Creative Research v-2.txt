Data Arts Practice
   * Broad range of work.
   * Work a lot in processing.
     * A layer on top of Java.
   * Research is in the name of our company and we want to make sure that we get deep with the data and the way we present it.
     * Try to get someone in the phone that is god with this stuff, put google away.
     * Is there someone that knows the data set that we can reach out to and have coffee with them.
   * We do all this experamentation and prototyping.
     * Have developed this practice not only for art pieces but also sort through complex data problems.
   * Taking our practice of complicating artworks and using it in other directions.
   * Its really dangerous to anticipate that their nothing in representing the data in a certain way.
   * We are always using visualisation as a tool.
     * The data exploration and interrogation phase.
     * Question farming.
       * We're not really looking for answer, we are looking for better questions.
Current Projects
   * Flood-watch
*
     * Ford foundation
     * Visualize their Ad streams
       * Create a way to document and record the type of ads that they are seeing.
       * Compared themselves to other people.
         * comparing different demographics
         * Discrimination and big data.
         * Racial and income level demographics.
   * Arguendo
*
     * Stage choreography.
     * Projection design.
       * All of the types of data the layers are talking about are visualized.
       * In collaboration with an ontologist.
         * Live Data Expedition.
 * MoMA Residency
   * A document of a cultural history.
     * How do we bring these things into play.
   * Instead of visualizing the data, is there a way we can perform it.
*
     * Big Data can be really boring.
     * The general posture towards big data, even in digital humanities.
       * The basic posture is what question can we ask and get a definitive answer for that.
         * The has its purpose.
       * We see something beautiful in the data itself, exploring and walking through it.
     * How can we make them useful and not only have be about their utility.
   * The function for data is to solve things and answer.
     * We free data to be performed, and shared.
     * creating a data set to perform.
     * Everything that was spoken had to be verbatim from the database.
     * If we did it again we want to focus on capturing the weirdness on these titles.
       * Found an amazing book about all the titles of artwork.
     * Somethings also come naturally from the data.
       * Counted the first names.
         * The most popular name for an artist in the database is John, and Peter.
         * Creating a natural resting place.
         * It took 40 men names before there was a woman name.
           * Tension, trying to get their names into the stream.
           * I love the idea about data and performance but this sold me the opportunity.
   * Having a data make fun of itself.
   * Having a data critique itself.
   * There are many ways to look at this data.
   * This is not a visualization of the data collection, just a subset of that data.
   * Github
     * Technical result of MoMA project.
   * We we're asked to do a 6 month residency at the Museum of Modern Art.
   * Doing work around their collection archive 20,000 (Session Collection)
     * Formally in the collection.
     * Committee created to add to the collection.
   * What the collection looks like and the form that it was delivered to us.
     * CVS 102,047 Lines
       * Comma Separated Values
         * Can break machinery that you are trying to feed it into.
       * Pretty commonly how our work starts.
       * A data set and off you go.
       * Hard to navigate this gigantic stream.
       * Trying to do some work of what the data looks like.
     * Titles of Artworks are really interesting.
       * They are interesting in what they contain, and what they don't contain.
       * "Untitled" is the most common tittle.
       * Sol Lewitt titles are the longest.
         * The title is the instruction and the work.
     * Specially when dealing with text based data.
       * What are some ways we can easily find patterns through text.
*
       * Analyze a sentence and see the parts of speech.
*
       * Fun tool to play with, a really good way to get an understanding.
         * See what these computational concepts allows us to do.
         * The results of these explorations, were a set of possible scripts.
 * NASA Popular Science
*
   * A design problem, how do you show 50 some odd years of history.
     * Find out what one version of that story might be.
   * One of the reasons we want to show this project is to show the tendency that we are not good at doing things the simple way.
   * Creating a text based timeline.
   * Produced something very similar to our simple sketches we started with in the white board even though there was so many man hours.
   * How much work do we do, when do we just let the data take over.
     * Google's operational strategy.
       * Just collect enough data even though not all of it is good.
   * Most of the work was done through a program we made that sorts the words into specific categories.
   * One of the challenges about this type of work is foreseeing where this data can take you before we do the work.
 * Balance between the way we want to explore the data and a client could explore the data.
   * Picking clients that we are ethically inclined with.
   * If you build they will come mentality.
     * If you want to make experimental work, show in your portfolio experimental work.
 * How do you guys deal with Data? #question
   * There is this perception that data is very neutral, and the institutions who created are mean to be truthful, in reality is selected already. #question
   * How do you deal with that aspect of it? #question
   * Allan Morris
     * Series of essays for the New York TImes, not a new conclusion, every photograph is a lie.
     * Photographs its a representation of the event.
     * By its very existence its biased.
     * Data is in the same way.
     * This idea of objectivity in data.
       * I don't think there is objectivity in Data.
       * To pursue objectivity is falsy.
         * Building a facade.
       * Saying that a visualization is true and accurate you are lying.
       * By accepting that its not you embrace, understand and reveal the biases.
     * Every visualization should have error bars.
       * Users feel uncomfortable with having that data represented, but it a true aspect of the visualization.
   * The whole data world is this last bastion of modernity.
     * Thinking that this data will make the whole world better.
     * What does post data look like.
     * Thinking of ways that are not so literal and linear.
   * Tufte
     * Every pixel in a data visualization has to have a purpose!
       * Really?
   * What is the smallest dataset you have ever dealt with? #question
     * When does it become a pile of information?
     * Sometime the data set is not big but the story is big.
     * Using an Avengers comic api.
       * Built of these visualiatoins of the character.
       * Not a big data set, just a few hundred issues.
       * If you know the data it can still feel like a big data set.
       * Data that is not necessarily big can still be visualized in meaning ful ways.
         * To people who knows the story is something more than that.
   * Data being fractal like.
     * Every data point could open up a new way of representing it.
