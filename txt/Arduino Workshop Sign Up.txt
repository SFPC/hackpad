Arduino Workshop Sign Up
With Zach D. and Andrew K.!!! Guaranteed Fun.

Newbie Course (2+/- hr): Wednesday Dec 10th 10am-12pm
Sign up (please indicate if you have an Arduino you can bring):
Christo Allegra I think I have some in storage, let me track them down.
Zan!  (um... I can buy an arduino if I need to - let me know)
Sarah GP: My arduino is in my robot, so I'd rather use a different one
Nathan Rosenberg (I have an arduino)
Paige (I can also buy an arduino if I need to (I kind of want one) - let me know as well)
Franc Camps-Febrer  (I don't have one, but I may get one before then)
Lauren Gardner (i have one)
Meghana Khandekar (don't have one)
Defne Onen (don't have one)

 *  I'm ordering 7 Arduinos and we have about 5 at the school, so we should be covered. You can also buy the arduinos I'm getting now to keep. $24 each.  

Beyond Newbie Course (2+/- hr): Thursday Dec 11th 10am-12pm
Sign up (please indicate if you have an Arduino you can bring):
Zan!
zach l (I can bring a bunch too if need be, we have heaps in the studio)
Sarah GP
Christo Allegra 
Nathan Rosenberg (have arduino)
Rachel Rose Ulgado (I don't have my arduino with me, sorry!)
Paige
Franc Camps-Febrer 
Lauren Gardner (i have one)
Yuki (I have 2xuno and 1xmega, and some sensors/step-motors. if you need spares, you can use them)
Meghana Khandekar (don't have one)




Rough outline for classes (still in progress):

Pre-course expectations:  
 * Bring Arduino if you have one.  Be willing to work with partner if not enough devices.
 * Download and confirm operation of Arduino 1.0.6 software.

Newbie Course: 1.5 hr

What is it? single chip computer (5 min)
How is it different from other small computers
Powering. 5v and 3.3v regulated systems. 
Programming IDE : C/C++
Example files. 
Basic Structure: global variables, setup, loop, custom functions. 

Exercise 1: flash onboard LED (10 min)
Emphasize:  declaring PINS as input or output in setup. Controlling digital PINs.  Using time. 
                                                            
Exercise 2: Serial output for debugging. (5 min)
Emphasize: declaring baud rate, Output data types. Output runtime, output LED state. 

Exercise 3: control external LED with PWM. (10 min)
Emphasize: what is PWM. analog vs        digital Fade LED - fade colors on RGBled

Exercise 4:  Digital Input with push button.  (15 min)
Emphasize: Debouncing switches, pull-up, pull-down resistors 

Exercise 5: Analog input (photoresistor) (15 min)
        Analog to Digital Conversion 
        Control an 8 bit tone

Exercise 6: Control DC. motor with external MOSFET. (15 min)
Emphasize: current limitations of Microcontroller pins.  how transistor works. Role of diode. 

Exercise 7: Servo Control (15 min)

A few tips for troubleshooting:
        Test individual components before creating a complex system.
        Do not leave a circuit on while building or when it doesnâ€™t do what you expect.
