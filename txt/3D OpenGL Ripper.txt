3D Maps Ripper
References:
On Exactitude in Science | Borges - great literary reference, also see Jean Baudrillard - 'Simulacra and Simulation'

Project ideas:
 * Kinect body capture at huge scale over LES, 'Godzilla mode'
 * Kinect scan my apartment (http://hackaday.com/2013/06/08/3d-mapping-of-rooms-again/) / 3d print via thin LIA method

Tools:
3d Ripper DX – http://www.deep-shadows.com/hax/3DRipperDX.htm
 * Notes: Crashes on startup of Google maps. Doesn't show the debug info [top left] to indicate it's running. No files written.
 * Got it launching Google Earth with 3D Ripper DX but turns out it was OpenGL mode. Doesn't run in Direct X. 
GLIntercept – http://code.google.com/p/glintercept/
 * Seems to be well documented and is supposed to work, we just can't get it to.
 * Notes: Modified file, ran Google Earth in OpenGL mode. Turns out Earth is flat in OpenGL(!) Nothing written to disk. Made for Microsoft Windows 2000 & XP. 
APITrace – https://github.com/apitrace/apitrace
 * Notes: Looks promising, though no mention of depth buffer info... 
http://www.opengl.org/sdk/tools/BuGLe/
 * Notes: Made for Linux. Can be compiled in C++ on Windows but sounds super complicated.

OGLE – http://members.chello.at/~alexan/
 * From Eyebeam 2011 runs as a DLL with GLIntercept

 * Notes: Looks promising... 
Xcode Utility: OpenGL Driver Monitor
 * Notes: Downloading Graphics Tools plugin for xCode via this comment. Had to sign up for Dev account.

Notes: 
Looked in OS X maps app folder. 
http://frumin.net/ation/2011/04/openstreetblock.html [link broken on site]
 * A web service for turning a given lat/long coordinate (e.g. 40.737813,-73.997887) into a textual description of the actual city block to which the coordinate points (e.g. "West 14th Street bet. 6th Ave. & 7th Ave") using OpenStreetMap data.

 * Apparently the format used by google earth.
