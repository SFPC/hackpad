Before You Leave
 * Make sure all windows are closed before you leave (or that the last person out knows to do that)
 * Turn off all the lights on Floor 2 + Floor 4. Hallway lights should always be on.
 * Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday nights: Take out trash (if full)
 * Tuesday: Take out recycling

Where Stuff Is:
 * FL2: toilet paper, paper towels, trash and recycling bags are in the IKEA expedit by the orange overhead lamp.
 * FL3: toilet paper, paper towels, hand soap, cleaning solutions, trash and recycling bags are in the white cabinet opposite the bathrooms; tools, parts, swiffer, dust broom are in the back storage room next to the refrigerator
 * FL4: mop is in the 2nd bathroom.

Where Stuff Goes:
 * Trash goes in black bags only.  If a bag is full, tie it up and bring it down to FL 2 and leave it by the first bathroom. (or, if it’s a trash day, just take it outside to the curb.
 * Recycling goes in clear bags only. If you have a full bag (watch to make sure it’s not too heavy as these bags are not the strongest) take it down to the FL2 kitchen by the elevator shaft.  Same goes for cardboard/paper.

Networking issues:
 * Power-cycle the cable modem on FL2 (it’s on top of the black rack close to Rivington Street)
 * Power-cycle the Airport Extreme on FL3 (next to the printer)
