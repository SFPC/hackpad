Making LED balloons

So a friend of mine wants to have some balloons illuminate, for a party that lasts at least 6 hours. The brighter the better.

Well its a good thing that 2032 CRC batteries will last an LED for over a day easily, especially if you use a resistor to limit the initial current !

get stuff from http://www.adafruit.com/

LED floaties
 * balloons 
 * 10mm diffused led  (2x25 = $25)
 * 2032 battery (50 = $75)
 * 220 ohm resistor (2x25 = $5)

50 LED floaties will be anywhere from $50-$100
