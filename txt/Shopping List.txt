Le Wei
 * actually contact mic! (11/8)
 * note: I have alot of contact mics, how many? they usually require amplification.... do you need tube-preamps and / or sound card for multichannel?  (mics are cheap, not adverse to ordering also).
 * theoretically only need one, but it might be good to have extras. not sure about amplification, what i want to do is pretty simple i think? but i'll talk to you or taeyoon about it.  
 * if you need it going into software (microphone) you'll definitely need amplification, since the mic is very low power.  I have nice tube pre-amps, like:

 * ps: if you need a mic quickly you can run to guitar center at atlantic mall, ask at the guitar desk, they have them for acoustic guitars for about 20$ if I recall.  I think also Rachel has a small one...
