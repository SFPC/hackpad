 * obstacle course / maze / tunnel of geometric shapes
 * binary games?
 * recreate the experience of being at sfpc-- round table w/chairs for discussions, possibly a(our) sofa/chairs/flies etc.
 * sfpc twister game
 * have bunch of images/magazines and attendees can humanly recreate experience of google image recognition

impromptu meeting: wed.. oct.30th
(in attendance: tega, andy, jonathan d., simona, moises, rachel)

From discussions today-- the general group idea seems to be-- lets do "analog" what we so often do "digitally" and recreate algorithms/processes in fun interactive ways.

people will be expecting us to show what digital things we've created w/computation & poetry, so we're interested in showing them something else-- namely analog versions of the digital systems they expect to see.

informal-- everyone takes off shoes such as in a home environment
special dish-- simona
possible book-- instruction/lesson/learning book
