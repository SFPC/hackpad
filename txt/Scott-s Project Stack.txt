Scott's Project Stack
Projects:
 * Make cheap 3d scanner with RGBDToolkit
 * Get an oF CV AR example up and running...on my face
 * Map Met art to 3d spaces and BIM model...via Dahan
 * Write translator for words-to-music (see sketchbook)
 * Write image-to-ascii converter in oF.
 * Create a device for measuring wifi network strengths in a graphic way // Immaterials AHO
 * Dahan, can you help me polish off a bash script I started to do this? It uses Rsync and ssh to sync a local Dropbox folder to a personal server.  http://vimeo.com/21677801

Technologies:
 * SLAM, photogrammetry, 3d ripping, AR, spatial APIs, RGBDToolkit to models, matchmoving

Questions "Poetic ":
 * How can we map physical spaces digitally?
 * How can we map digital spaces physically?

Questions "Tech":
 * How can augmented reality be done without GPS or CV (an in-between scale)?
 * What's the cheapest/easiest setup for SLAM/Simultaneous Localization and Mapping?
 * What's the cheapest 3D Scanner we can make?
 * What's the cheapest eyetracking get up? Does it need to be goggle based?
 * Can we create an AR experience of the Met's entire collection?
 * Can Google's Project Tango be replicated with a cell phone and a Kinect?

Questions "Easy":
 * what are good options to port oF code to web apps? Or do you have to rebuild it?
 * What are the most useful quick keys in xcode? Cmd + / for sure, cmd + r to run
 * what are best practices for getting older oF code to run (@alexander, zach)
 * What's the easiest way to post oF to web? Like processing.js equivalent?
 * What's more efficient? 12 ofBoxes or 64 ofQuads?
