Zach class
 * make list of questions
 * sort them collaboratively
 * Design a tool or a game to teach Binary Numbers
 * Create a programming Language that draw a triangle inside of a circle inside of a square.



 * Tuesday, April 22
Zach's follow up email on the day after
 *  create tools / systems / scenarios for writing and reading code not on the screen.  
 * are there better systems you can develop for working with code?   For identifying questions and understanding?
 * tell a story using variable names.  you code should compile, but also be interesting and evocative to read as text. focus on code as text, can you play with this?  
 * Look at poems by apollinaire.   outrageous examples can be found in the obfuscated code contest (http://www.ioccc.org/2000/bmeyer.c) and also in ishac's code poems: 
 * http://www.creativeapplications.net/processing/code-poems-by-ishac-bertran-poetry-with-code/
 * (there should be a copy at school)
 * feel comfortable with scope and variables and arrays.   make some sketches.  
 * read some code that's out of your comfort level, generate a bunch of question about it. 
 * play with memory in weird ways - make programs that crash.

poetry class with Taeyoon
 * constraint writing
 * create game or activity based on poem:
 * At Dawn
 * 
 * In my dream the head of a child was in the center.
 * 
 * If the clouds gather on your roof and the rain spares you, will you keep the secret of this double miracle?
 * 
 * But no voice calls you. If you get up, barefoot, you'll get sick. Where would you go, anyway, across these ravines of light.
 * 
 * The quilts keep the silence. Legs folded under, he walks on his wings and goes out. He was an angel and the whiter morning that was rising.

Purposely misuse every communication tool.
 * Only respond using the “wrong” service (respond to SMS with Twitter, etc.)

 * Over-interact with people (like responding to every “Like” or “Favorite” as if it were a comment)
 * Thursday, May 1
Kyle + Lauren workshop
Pair up and create 'filter' that 
 * enhance
 * distort
social interaction 

Tega + Taeyoon spectulative history of computing
To Think About
 * How can we think beyond the existing models of computers and their inherent politics?
 * How else could computers be in the world?
 * What are alternative criteria for computational design?
 * How could agency be distributed differently in our technological systems?

Speculative Design Exercise
 * Design an alternative GUI for an operating system based on a different set of visual metaphors to that of the desktop
 * Or, design an operating system that adopts a different set of metaphors based on a system other than that of war/military (ie instead of "execute," "command line," etc)
 * We encourage you to conceive of an alternative history that has led to the development of this alternative computer system. If war was not the driving force, what would there be instead? Does this position computation differently as to its role in our lives, our relationships with computers, our relationships together?
