much crypto, such currency, dogecoin wow

 * Setup
To use dogecoin, you need to store it in a wallet. You usually want to run a wallet on your computer or mobile phone. Each wallet will need to sync with the entire dogecoin network to be up-to-date. First, download a wallet:

               * Android         OSX          Windows

While its syncing, go to the much receive tab, click on the first address, and copy address. Then paste it here:
 * Jonathan: DTWJPdJTuzxkbpcLxh3ojAapdapGnk4Nu8 
 * Tega : DNmuCGaRffUjV8zcaxvCxa6fEXCrfUUxPK 
 * Jon: DTXreAxyunEccVrtBSYKo5DnDPG8AsJyUK 
 * Motoi: DMc5zj7dE4Zjn6huG6Eb1itYsPbTi1cwjB
 *  turn your address into a qr code for easy donations:  https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/?data=<YOUR ADDRESS HERE>

Once the client completely syncs up (it will take a while, cuz its ~5Gb), you should have some doge in there from me :)

 * Wow what can I do now?
http://dogeearth.com is a not so up-to-date listing of what can be done with dogecoin. 
I offer 20% off my day rate for people who pay in dogecoin.
I bought a cappuccino one time in SF for doge.

 * Why dogecoin?
These are personal reasons why I started messing with dogecoin

 * to learn what the hell crypto currencies are
 * to learn more about currency and economics in general
 * to provide an alternative, decentralized currency with a known, stable inflation rate
 * its cheaper than bitcoin
 * the community is more about sharing and giving than greed

 * How is this different than bitcoin?
There are lots of differences, here are the ones I think are interesting
 * from an implementation standpoint, a fixed, small, known inflation means the currency encourages people to USE the coin, and not hoard it. It discourages pump-and-dump investors

 * Anything else?
The more people use this as an actual replacement of currency, instead of as a stopgap medium between dollars and just for investment purposes, the better off the currency becomes. 

Also, have fun tipping, if you ever need more coin just ask. This is the tip of the iceberg, you can mine coin, or trade USD for dogecoin (though its kinda hard to right now).
