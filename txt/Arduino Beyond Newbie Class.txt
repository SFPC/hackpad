Arduino Beyond Newbie Class
Short review from class 1 (5 min)
 * TBD
 * Questions from class one?
 * A quick note about libraries 
   * Install - libraries will show up in your Arduino folder in "Documents"
*
 * Be sure to check the examples to see if your library came with examples:
 * *
 * 
 * Get some libraries:
 * http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/Libraries

 * No special characters in library names!!!

 * What a standard library includes (keypad below):
*

It can be helpful to look at the keywords file:
 * *
 * 
Storing a value in EEPROM (10 min)
 * EEPROM = Electronically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory
 * Ram is zeroed when power is removed from the microcontroller.  EEPROM is the only way to record variables without an external SD card.
 * EEPROM addresses are 8 bits (0-255).
*

Example code ( a device that does something different each time it's restarted:

Similar example: does a different thing each time you turn it on: https://vimeo.com/89358523

Storing numbers larger than a byte in EEPROM:
Example: a device that changes based on how many times it has been reset/unplugged:
(requires LED on pin 12)

AVR Direct Port Manipulation (5 min)
Control many pins with less code.  Get close to the metal!
Ports:
 * B (digital pin 8 to 13)
 * C (analog input pins)
 * D (digital pins 0 to 7)

 * DDR(port) = B00000000 //sets port as input or output
 * PORTD = B00000000 //sets all pins low
*

Making Arduino random( ) = MORE random! (5 min)
http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/Random
http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/RandomSeed
randomSeed(analogRead(0));    //use this as a seed value.  Reads analog value on pin that has nothing actually hooked to analog pin.  This is also known as a floating input.

Hardware Interrupts and Sleep ( 5 min)
What are they good for? = A button that can be pressed at any time in the program!
 * Uno Interrupts are on Digital 2 (Interrupt 0) and Digital 3 (Interrupt 1)
 * Interrupt can detect LOW, RISING, FALLING, CHANGE, HIGH
 * AttachInterrupt(interrupt address, function, detection constant); 
 * ISR (interrupt service routines) cannot pass variables 
 * Interrupts wake Arduino from sleep.

BUILD: Add button to from Digital Pin 2 to GND.

CODE:
*
Sleeping:
The Arduino has a handful of sleeping functions that it understands by invoking commands specific to the atmel chip. To use sleep functions, we usually need to include these three header files:
 * #include <avr/sleep.h>
 * #include <avr/power.h>
 * #include <avr/wdt.h>

These allow us to use power saving modes like:

 *      *     SLEEP_MODE_IDLE         -the least power savings
 *      *     SLEEP_MODE_ADC
 *      *     SLEEP_MODE_PWR_SAVE
 *      *     SLEEP_MODE_STANDBY
 *      *     SLEEP_MODE_PWR_DOWN     -the most power savings

Each of these modes allows different circuitry (timers, oscillators) to go to 'sleep' and help save power.  There are two ways an Atmel Chip can be awoken from a sleep, by a special kind of timer, or by a signal using our friend the interrupt.  

For waking with a timer there's a separate clock on the chip, called a watchdog timer, which periodically wakes the MCU back up. Watchdog timers typically have an 8 sec maximum wait before they "bite" or check for an interrupt but can be as quick as 30 ms.  

There are other libraries that simplify low power commands, enerlib is one example.  A new favorite is Narcoleptic!  

Download the library here:  
https://code.google.com/p/narcoleptic/downloads/detail?name=Narcoleptic_v1a.zip

Here's a simple example:  
 * {
 * #include <Narcoleptic.h>
 * 
 * void setup() {
 *   pinMode(2,INPUT);        // set pin 2 as input 
 *   digitalWrite(2,HIGH);   //  pull it high initially 
 *   pinMode(13,OUTPUT);     //  make 13 an output 
 *   digitalWrite(13,LOW);   //  initially set it low 
 * }
 * 
 * void loop() {
 *   int a;
 * 
 *   // Merlin the cat is snoozing... Connect digital pin 2 to ground to wake him up.
 *   Narcoleptic.delay(500); // During this time power consumption is minimised
 * 
 *   while (digitalRead(2) == LOW) {
 *     // Wake up CPU. Unfortunately, Merlin does not like waking up.
 * 
 *     // Swipe claws left
 *     digitalWrite(13,HIGH);
 *     delay(50);
 *     
 *     // Swipe claws right
 *     digitalWrite(13,LOW);
 *     delay(50);
 *   }
 * 

Here's another example using an interrupt and the avr library instead.

Talk with Processing or OF. (15 min)
First, communicate without Firmata!!!
use Serial.write( );

Code on Arduino:
*
https://gist.github.com/extrasleepy/c2807755b6276da6bdac
Processing Code:
*
https://gist.github.com/extrasleepy/3269fc604e0bde755128
 * //Processing function to print serial ports
 * println(Serial.list());
 * 
 * //Listing the available serial ports with a for loop!!
 * for (int i = 0; i < Arduino.list().length; i++) {
 *     println(i + " --> " + Arduino.list()[i]);
 *   }



Going the other way:

Upload 'Standard Firmata' to the UNO:
Examples -> Firmata -> Standard Firmata 

In processing install the Arduino library here-> 
http://playground.arduino.cc/Interfacing/Processing
Then run the 'Arduino Output' skectch in: 
Processing->Examples->Contributed Libraries->Arduino Output


Super Simple Arduino/OF sketch using Firmata:

I2C other modules (20 min)  
I2C = synchronous, bus (devices can be chained to one "master" device)

 * 2-wire communication standard
 * SDA = (Serial Data) OR Analog 4
 * SCL = (Serial Clock) OR Analog 5
 * Use "Wire" library for I2C.

*

 * 1. Send the START bit (S).
 * 2. Send the slave address (ADDR).
 * 3. Send the Read(R)-1 / Write(W)-0 bit.
 * 4. Wait for/Send an acknowledge bit (A).
 * 5. Send/Receive the data byte (8 bits) (DATA).
 * 6. Expect/Send acknowledge bit (A).
 * 7. Send the STOP bit (P).

Since the devices are addressable, you can have many devices on one bus!!!!

Multiplexing (10 min)

Multiplexing!  
-Allows us to control many digital states without using an equal number of digital pins on the Arduino. With a common chip like the 74HC595 16 leds can be controlled by using only 3 digital pins on the arduino.  
-Achieved by quickly scanning across each intersection of the 'rows and columns' hundreds of times a second the multiplexer is able to uniquely control each intersection or led in this example.
