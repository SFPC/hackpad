SFPC Discussion about Education

 * Creating platform for learning to occur
 * the philosophy that could be shared, for learning to occur.
 * About an hour
 * Propose Questions
 * Out side of traditional Academy
 * Ideas of community building.
 * Teaching at ITP
   * With Zach, 3D sensing class
   * Been kind of teching alot of 2 credit classes
     * First semester teachching a 12 week class
       * Difference between a free school model and SFPC
     * Something are only possible in longer times
     * Also have done one day workshops
       * 6 to 9 hours + lunch
       * There is different toopics you can teach in these environments
   * Something similar to SFPC where poeple are sharing the space and being continously ambient about and other and the space.
     * Teaching code for art program and creative projects.
     * Started studying art in a grad program.
       * No one knew how to code.
       * Most where working with editing video andcreating sounscapes.
       * I felt like I was prepared, once I was in grad school.
     * Not really what we run into at SFPC, RISD, and ITP
       * SImultaneusly learning about both.
     * Such a range of backgrounds and skill level.
       * Traditional computer science.
       * There is a bell curve.
       * Not the same in an art context.
         * Don't want my students to feel like the fail.
         * Hard to keep them engaged and challenge.
       * Hard to expand the range you are teaching to without diluting the teaching. #tip
       * Technical stress is so incredible.
       * Fine Art School is meant to be open-ended
         * To have both is quite a challenge.
 * Questions about the School
   * Who came with strong technical background.
   * Who came with poetry.
   * Who came to learn about poetry.
   * Who came to learn technical skills.
 * SFPC Reflections
   * Things we we're struggling with teaching the technology to artistic people.
   * We got to the computation in someway but how do you teach the poetry.
   * How do you teach how to make a creative work.
   * And instigation or provocation.
   * Succeeded in someway, teaching the technology to artist is one thing but doing the opposite is another.
 * When I see something that is beautiful code how do I share that feeling.
 * Not knowing technical things became a way to learn poetry.
   * Coding thinking is still little bit of a mystery.
 * Really hard to be reflective when you're doing something.
   * If you don't reflect making the end product might not give a much feedback.
 * Techincal stuff is not easy to teach.
   * You can give someone the feeling that is easily to learn things.
   * Understand how to teach themselves further.
   * COmes down alot to the way that people are dedicated about learning.
   * THe students apporach about cultivating the right attitute towards learning.
 * Value in both everyone talking among each other.

How do you teach the poetry?
   * Unaswareable questions that stick with you.
     * Dont happen everday.
     * Presents a question to you.
     * Those questions will nag you and stay with you.
       * A situation that is inescaple.
       * You can't learn about poetry without answaring those questions.
   * You can lear teachnicall things didacttily.
   * Collaboration is a really good way to learn abou someones processes.
     * Alot of their processes will rub off on you.
   * Some where between didactic and collaboration.
   * What is art?
     * What grade do you think you deserve.
     * Not just about something you show in a classroom is about your commitment its about a full practice.
     * Not just an artist for a couple of hours.
   * Run a creq in installation theatrical experiences.
     * Creaitng experiences that connect rdirectly with what it means to be human.
     * Typologies and true desires about human nature.
     * Trying to make a tech project with maxMSP that relates to a typology seems to be a pretty good way to get people to start interacting with this stuff.
     * They start moving away from technology.
   * Performance Poetry Side
     * 360 degree interactive spoken word video.
     * Teach poeople about poetry.
     * There are three basic things that I go by.
       * The best word in the best order.
       * What is the qualitative value.
       * Rhythm is where the information is.
       * The medium is the poetry.
     * MDR Smith
       * We speak in organic poems.
       * Its really our job as artist and creators to carve it out of space.
     * Making poetic things.
       * What does it mean to have Poetics as a goal and how does that affect.
       * What does it mean to include Pottry in the school.
       * Really like the complxity of the word and the confusion that it makes.
         * The Poetics of Computation.
           * Something that is not addressed, usually taught a technical thing not a creative medium.
           * Things that you can do in this medium that are poetic.
           * Those two things that are never apart.
         * What is the value of Poetic computation in the concept of teaching.
         * The biggest probem that Isaw was not having enough time for students to precesses these things, create space for them to reflect on these things.
         * Important for part of the name.
           * What is this medium, creative coding.
           * Around the time for Maedas book.
           * Where does the word Creative Coding comes from.
             * The creative class, creative city, try to find a new phrase, replace that term.
             * Trying to describe the medium in a different way.
           * Did you find that teaching in Poetic Computation was different that teaching at Parsons.
             * Intersection of design and technology with a design curriculum.
             * Finished thesis in May.\I really did what I wanted to in at SFPC.
             * So many different classes that you just have to pass.
             * We use poetic to cover ourselves in to crazy concepts.
             * We would ask for homework, long list of homework.
               * You can pick just one of them.
             * The is no room for homework.
     * Optional and Dedication conflict.
       * Everyone just being there was enough.
       * Assignments = Propositions.
       * What we wanted was selecting students to work with people that we could work with in the future.
         * Creating different ways in which things can be taught.
         * Mix between an artist residency and a teaching group.
         * Provide an environment to create work with.
       * How the studens can go on with this experience.
         * Spread this method of sharing.
     * Telling people at the opening taught ten minutes at parsons, when students complaint here I am the administration.
       * Late night ten minute gchats.
       * Had to evolve as we go.
     * Will you still go for having different technical levels.
       * How to wrok with skill level differences.
       * Try a different method and look at the results.
       * Scheduled time and not scheduled time.
     * What to change and what to keep.
       * Started the school with writing questions.
       * Starting the school not with anwers, led to conversations and discovery.
       * Writing down ideas earlier.
         * If thats the case there should be more talking about ideas, and then talk about technology about afterwards.
         * Learning to be artist.
         * How to become an arttist in a tech medium.
In what ways did not working for grades change the environment?
   * There was room for failure.
   * Making everything optional, put the onus on the students to get things out of it.
   * How to carve out time space in order to go deep on something.
   * Its good that we were over subscribed we were able to pull out of it the things that were most interesting.
What was your best educational experience?
Really good moment or favorite class or educational moment?
