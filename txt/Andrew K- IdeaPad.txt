Andrew K: IdeaPad

Inspired by Taeyoon: Just started posting sketchbook pages (good and bad) online:  http://bit.ly/sleepysketchbook

Some things I'm thinking about:

 * "Excessive Tech" - like garbage cans with electronics built in.  What about a garbage can that encouraged you to throw more things away?  Keeps track of how much you throw away and encourages you to set more aggressive goals - sends tweets?
 * Saw this at LaGuardia:

 * Thinking about inexpensive electronic street art:

 * Would love to work on some generative 3D printing with ceramic:

 * Maybe metal as well:

 * Slowly changing bag robots, small, using small servos:
 * Plastic bag covered or brown paper bag covered.

 * Generative artwork in general interests me: I would love to do some noisy generative characters that always look different and are very wiggly and frumpy:  https://www.flickr.com/photos/akleindolph/15577557386/in/set-72157646553946763

 * Thinking about crazy custom shaped circuit boards/circuit traces.  Inefficient drawings with traces.  Unfinished test here:

 * Interactive: High stakes + high probability to win - phone gets destroyed OR player wins $1.  95% chance to win:

 * Piece held together with magnetism.  When viewer presses button, magnetism shuts off and entire piece falls apart.  Viewer must choose to rebuild or leave: https://www.flickr.com/photos/akleindolph/15598127471/in/set-72157646553946763

 * Device that is hard wired to burn up if not tweeted to after a certain amount of time.

 * Has digital health meter:

 * Maybe it's about my own account and retweets?

 * Node.js with servos?
*

 * Sound with Teensy microcontroller  - Thinking about small interactive sound producing lo-fi devices.  Maybe made from crumpled paper? milk cartons? https://www.flickr.com/photos/akleindolph/15598258021/in/set-72157646553946763
