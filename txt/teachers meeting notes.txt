teachers meeting notes 
Sep 24

Hey y'all, I am still in Queens. Thinking it'd make sense to Hangout in, rather than be 40 min late to LES to give a quick report on finance stuff. This is me, if that works:

" Although my current responsibilities as an associate professor in media, communication and digital humanities at the New Jersey Institute of Technology make it difficult to join your classes now, I actually look forward to taking the time and participating as a student for a term sometime in the near future. Most of my research is in computation and writing, specifically the electronic literary arts, and remains directed in many ways by the Electronic Literature Organisation (ELO). The ELO works particularly with authors of all genres and literary aims, who remain interested in publishing and engaging with electronic or digital formats in media. Their Website is at eliterature.org.

It's been recently brought to my attention that the digital poet Jhave Johnson, formerly based in Montreal, but now working in Hong Kong, will be visiting NYC in October soon after your Fall 2014 term begins. His interest here is to hold a very informal ELO "salon gathering" around the third or fourth week of that month. I think his work would prove to be very interesting to your students and teachers working together this fall. I'm confident he would find your institute incredibly stimulating. Plus I think any opportunity to bring the ELO and SFPC together for an afternoon/evening would no doubt produce a stellar set of conversations and debates. You can see at this Website some of the work he is best known for: http://glia.ca/about.html."

Oct 25 Fundraiser workshop
can be other dates. one weekend event to raise $$$ for the fall term. 

Oct 27 IHEAP + SFPC  CUNY graduate center

org: Taeyoon, Michael Maniberg 

> The event aims to serve as a mise-en-relation between the Institut des hautes études en arts plastiques (Iheap) of Paris, and the School for Poetic Computation of New York City, both “schools” which operate at the educational periphery. The session will consist of a series of reciprocal presentations: commenced by introductions of the history, context and mission of each program, followed by students’ articulation of their own practices and projects, and concluded as a broad discussion. We estimate that roughly 12-15 from Iheap, 10 from SPC, and 10 from CUNY, will be present.

November 7 NYU ITP + SFPC

org: Taeyoon, Midori (ITP)

open laptop/ open studio party

org: Taeyoon, Alexandria (Silent Barn), Kunal 

> workshop, experience for youth in Bushwick. part of taeyoon class, or SFPC mid-semester presentation. can be elements for adults and general public. 

"We are holding 11a - 7p, 11/22 & 11/23 on the calendar, for now. "

December 12 Farewell 

private party or open event.
nothing big and public
more for students and alumni
can be at Thoughtworks in Flat iron district, or former third ward building in Bushwick. thinking about accessibility: wheel chairs and etc.  

contact 
Andrew Mcwilliams 
"It mentions bring thrifty and keeping costs down with sponsorships etc. When you do your next round, let me know because maybe I can talk to ThoughtWorks about sponsorship.

Also, we have a nice space for up to around 60 people in flatiron, for presentations / workshops. And I could connect you to Livestream in Brooklyn who have a very nice presentation / installation space at the old Third Ward location in Williamsburg. They are looking for arts/tech crossover community events."

^ Taeyoon and I are still volleying back and forth on this, I did a pass last night to review everything so far.

My synopsis is that: 
 * We're in okay shape. We're, for the first time, building 30% overhead into the budget for taxes, etc (as recommended by our accountant), which gives us ~25k flex room.
 * We can use our own historical information to understand how things are increasing or decreasing. 
 * We keep putting off fundraising but it won't be hard.

Make sure everyone is cool with this, I'd like to tone down the photo release language that we borrowed from 3rd Ward, Gary would like his LLC added to it in the space section.

Fundraising Ideas

 * Apply for relevant grants: art, technology, education, STEM.
 * Teachers/alumni donate a day or two of time teaching workshops.
   * Zach could teach a day or two of workshops on Open Frameworks to raise about $4,000.
 * Hold some sort of one day conference. 70 attendees + $100 per ticket = $7,000. Potential costs: space, speaker honorariums.
 * Reach out to organizations who might be interested in sponsoring future students. Adafruit, for example.
 * Sell things: t-shirts, 1-bit computer kit.
 * Hold an art auction with donated artworks from alumni and friends of the school.
   * Put on a conference or workshop on how to start your own school. Gary would be open to hosting something like this for free because it could be mutually beneficial if it leads to more tenants for Orbital.
   * Consider renting space for longer than our session: time to teach students, and after school ends time to fundraise. Some of the possibilities include doing tours or walkthroughs. This might appeal to a more corporate crowd who is more interested in what’s possible (the results left behind by a session) than how to do it (the actual teaching during the session). As Gary puts it, "the output of the school’s creativity can be monetized." While we’d have to be vigilant that this doesn’t lead us down a path of creating work that leads to monetizable output, what Gary’s suggesting could leverage what is essentially exhaust of the program’s intensity in a way that exists outside of the active classroom time.
   * Recurring supporters program. Circle of funders. Could do this with an online payment system. Taeyoon also mentioned that he supports Triple Canopy annually by handwriting and mailing a check, and it feels special.
   * Gary’s general philosophy: create chaos.
   * Gary had read my "administrator’s lament" and he offered a different way of looking at things. "I’ve grown more comfortable with Capitalism. Money is a substitute for time. Think of money like water. Money poorly applied results in death and disaster. Water used right is the source of life.
   * Funding buddies for students. Match students with a patron.
   * The brilliance of Kickstarter’s tiered rewards system is that it provides for a range of participation. If you just ask somebody for $100, it might be awkward. The exchange of a reward, no matter how small or symbolic, makes it non-socially-awkward for somebody to hand you $100.
   * For every person physically at the school enroll five remote participants, paying less than the cost to be on-site. As a tradeoff for the way this could offset the cost of the program for on-site participants, each on-site participant commits to keeping in dialogue with five of the remote participants. This potentially expands the reach of the school’s teachings, is good practice for students becoming teachers, and engages a dialogue about online education.
   * Charge for a livestream.
   * Leverage a growing community of alumni, now at two classes with a combined 30 participants.
