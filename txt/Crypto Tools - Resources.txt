 * I tried this and right now it is buggy and crashes the mail app but it is the easiest to set up...

Using Thunderbird & Enigmail 
How to set it up
 * download 
   * thunderbird & install (don't set up your profile yet)
   * download enaigmail plugin for thunderbird
 * Open thunderbird - in 'Tools / Addons / Extensions manually add the plugin and restart*
 * Follow instructions here: https://www.enigmail.net/documentation/quickstart.php
 * support site: http://support.gpgtools.org/kb/how-to/first-steps-where-do-i-start-where-do-i-begin

 * tor
1) download tor from https://www.torproject.org and install
        * automatically opens a new browser using tor 'congrats'
2) can set up addresses for specific sites - http://kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion/ (hidden wiki) or decqjr53xivw7zjp.onion
        * set up under settings/services then add a new webpage/site - generates the key seen above
        * tails is similar but allows you to serve an entire site through https://tails.boum.org/
* tor will let you operate anonymously on the web until you log in to a site - good for browsing, not posting

 * Crypto Party

There are a lot of local chapters around the world. This is a good way to stay current on new tools and what's happening.
