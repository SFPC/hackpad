// Note: I'll work on a non-expanded (i.e. not 8GB) image and repost that with instructions when I can.
 * awesome thanks! downloading it now,,, I strumbled upon this link, guess it might be helpful http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/8305/how-to-make-an-image-img-from-whats-in-the-sdcard-but-as-compact-as-the-ori
 *  Nice, this looks promising... I had come across some documentation using parted, but this looks simpler. I'll give it a go.


 * Installation

Transfer image to the SD card
in terminal, use the application `dd` (if = input file, of = output file)
 * $ sudo dd bs=1m if=/dev/rdisk2 of-backup-image.dmg
These can be any file or memory on your computer, be very careful as ****wrong drive names can damage your files****

Terminal & how to find the right disk names
in terminal, everything is a file

 * $ ls
list file in directory

Capital names usually refer to user files
small caps are file that computer use,,, linux stuffs

 * $ /dev 
to access folder with all the drivers
 * ls -al *disk*
(list all the disk)

You'll see a list of disk in your computer

*

different colors represent different permission to each drive



Recommended SD CARD: Lexar 400x Professional: http://www.amazon.com/Lexar-Professional-UHS-I-Memory-LSD32GCTBNA400/dp/B007ADFV2M

Terminal Software:  iTerm http://www.iterm2.com/

Yorgo Alexopoulos has yorgo.org

after copy image file you might have to manually expand the partition of the disk,, depends on original SD card size vs your SD card size

OSC
kinda of protocol (actually sit on top of another protocol (UDP-based))
a way to send message over the network

 * Breakdown
 * image was expanded to 8gb, you might need to expand again if you have bigger card
 * wifi dongle >> easily setup go to Raspbian's GUI
 * use package manager to update/upgrade software (Update linux packages section)
 * (add samba support section)

tips
 * Desolder the LAN port out of the model B to make it draw much less power!
 * long wire soldered to GPIO can make it AM antenna! it's fast enough!

Pi story
 * 70s everything was exposed // study computer had no barrier
   * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64
 * it take a lot of work just to get to the same level of exposure on the modern computer
 * for the sake of next gen good engineers PI has born!
   * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi

 * sudo arp-scan --interface=bridge100 --localnet

list computer on this networks

 * ssh pi@192.168.2.4

to gain control remotely through SSH
 * cat /dev/urandom > /dev/fb0
write random number to the screen noiseeeeee!

 * cat /dev/zero > /dev/fb0
clear the screen with zero
 * cat /dev/input/mice > /dev/fb0
drag mouse and it draws into the screen by pixels

other interesting folders you want to access
 * /proc
 * /sys

if you want to access gpio1
 * /sys/class/gpio/gpio1




Samba server
Finder > Go > connect to server
 * smb://192.168.2.2/OF
connecting through Samba protocol
this will mount the drive to your computer...

 * what is user/pass
 * config to where to open up to 
 * more about how to put Samba on the pi  http://www.openframeworks.cc/setup/raspberrypi/Raspberry-Pi-SMB.html




 * GDB another solution for debugging
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gdbserver


 * Remote Access
If you are using internet connection sharing, ssh is the way to go
And if you want X, then you can use tightvncserver
But if you want framebuffer, there is only dispmanx_vnc, which has a bug where you can't use the mouse :(
I am looking at modifying the source to make sure uinput is being set correctly
But maybe it should be evdev and not uinput? I don't know
