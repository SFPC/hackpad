 * Social Glitch - Assignments
   * Being in New York, most people were ok with it.
   * Counting the phone made me hyperaware.
     * Strange anxiety about going on facebook.
   * What would it be like if every time you go to another webpage you do a push up.
   * Found the first assignment very difficult.
     * I think its really hard to totally violate societal norms.
   * Switching Phones for a Day
     * Was responding with some of his text messages.
       * Someone texted him hello social hacker.
   * Given a stranger some clear directions of how to use my phone.
   * Tweeted a .
     * In retrospective should have tweeted a space.
 * Posing as someone else, not look like someone, maybe have a vague resemblance to how the person talks.
 * Firs day reading about Experiments.
   * Excuse Me May I have your Seat.
*
     * Allows you to see what the structures in culture.
     * Why do we do this work are we just trying to fuck with people.
       * Shows how many ways we limit ourselves in interactions and technologies what is beyond that.
         * Creating norms that more interesting, genuine and connected.
       * Social constraints in different situations.
         * Have greater appreciation for why structures are in place.
       * Trying to get to the same level of realization that Robert Wong achieved at age ten.

 * Faces are what we are tuned to see.
     * Few Types
       * Detection
         * Boxes around the face.
       * Face Recognition, which face are you looking at.
       * FAce tracking watching something over time, contours and motions.
   * Look at it from a different perspective it is no longer the face.
   * Chernoff Faces
   * GIthub Example
     * http://auduno.github.io/clmtrackr/face_deformation_video.html
   * History of Face Tracking
     * Late 60s.
     * 8 years between academic and artist, to play with computer vision.
     * The turn over time is much less now a days.

       * Can tell the difference between twins.

         * Can see smaller feature that your eyes can see.
         * For large databases its less accurate.
           * Not because of the algorithms, but because of the quality of the photos.

     * Face Recognition Study CMU
       * 2009 an algorithm that would take public available data and create your social security number.
         * http://www.heinz.cmu.edu/~acquisti/face-recognition-study-FAQ/
         * Supposed to be something that no ones knows.
         * If someone has that number they can become you.
       * 2011, used the same algorithm but implementing a camera, and from the camera they can get someone's social security number.
Science of the face
   * https://github.com/kylemcdonald/AppropriatingNewTechnologies/wiki/Week-2
   * Once you have access to these algorithms you have access to interesting applications.
     * Haar Detection
       * *
     * Active Appearance Models.
       * *
     * New tools to do biometrics on faces.
 * FaceOSC
   * http://facetracker.net/downloads/
*
   * All of this data is transported through OSC.
   * Osculator
     * Will show you all of the data coming from faceOSC.
     * You can tell from osculator what all the different data is.
     * Once you have this data you can start making simple applications using the face.
 * CLMTracker
   * https://github.com/auduno/clmtrackr
*
   * Take any expression I'm making and amplifies it.

Linguistic Analysis

 * LIWC 
   * James Penna
   * http://www.liwc.net/
   * Linguistic Inquiry and word count.
   * Works better for large datasets.
   * WHen you are looking at short text the context shifts.
   * Haven't found any academic papers on sarcasm.
   * LSM Linguistic Style Matching
     * Who is more aggressive, Who is less aggressive.
     * Analyse similarities.
     * People who are balanced have a made more connected conversations
     * Test to see what the outcome of the conversation is going to be.
     * Running Linguistic Style Matchin on negotiators in hostage situations.
     * Used to analyze products or campaigns.
     * Major business running this type of analysis on twitter and facebook.
 * US+
   * An app that analyses your speech.
