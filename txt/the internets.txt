[wtf is] the internets?
 * facebook
 * connecting computers +1
   * this is just networking
 * networks of networks
 * tcp/ip
 * wires // its physical
 * gifs and cats
 * a communication protocol to send data between computers in disparate locations

what's the world wide web?
 * things you put in front of the url (www.) +1
   * http://no-www.org/
   * http://www.yes-www.org/
 * address pointers to where things are stored digitally on disparate computers on the network
 * servers
 * body of knowledge managed by straaaange people
 * protocols
 * public internet +1

"Things that are addressable over http"

 * wires
There is a physical presence to the internet.

We tried a few things: 
 * ping yoursite.com
 * curl yoursite.com

http response codes:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Response_codes
 * For example a "404" error is "Not Found â€“  Server can not find requested resource. This response code probably is most famous one due to its frequency to occur in web."

An easy tool for creating APIs for pages where there is none. 

We used the following code to pull a specific image from the Met database using the api from http://scrapi.org
 * JSONObject json;
 * PImage img;
 * String image_url="";
 * 
 * void setup() {
 *   json = loadJSONObject("http://scrapi.org/object/81781");  
 *   img = loadImage(json.getString("image"));
 *   size(img.width,img.height);
 * }
 * 
 * void draw() {
 *   image(img, 0, 0, img.width/4, img.height/4);
 * }

Assignment:
Use two different pieces of data that [don't require authentication] and combine them to make a 'data visualization.' 
 * Potential APIs:
   * Open Weather Maps (requires registration, then include API key in url request)
   * Department of Buildings  - I'd love to be able to track building violations and map open or old violations. It's a good way to find landlords who aren't very invested in their properties. (might not have an aip, might have to scrape...) Examples for the building where I live - http://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/PropertyProfileOverviewServlet?boro=3&houseno=139%20&street=plymouth%20st&requestid=0&s=A03C41B885B461E4F46BD08866A7430E
