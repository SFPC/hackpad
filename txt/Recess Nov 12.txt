Green-wood Cemetery
guide: Allison Meier 
http://www.green-wood.com/

Established in 1838 to get the dead out of the overflowing cemeteries of Manhattan and to give the living a beautiful place to retreat to nature. Burials stopped in Manhattan in the 1830s because of overcrowding. The front gate is a portal between the land of the living and the dead, modeled after a Gothic church entrance.

Grave for the Brooklyn theater fire of 1876, where 278 people died. 103 of the unidentified dead are burred under this oblique .  Late 19th century disasters were a major growing pain of large metropolises. Current theater regulations were informed by this disaster. The General Slocum  was another such tragedy that brought about major overhauls in regulations, ferry boats in that case.

Like any decent cemetery, part of Green-Wood is a potter's field, though it's been filled to capacity long ago. Among those who were buried in Green-wood's potter's field was the assistant of Louis Daguerre. He as on tour of America spreading the invention of photography when he died. His body was unclaimed and he was put to rest in an unmarked grave. 
For everyone who didn't know what a daguerreotype is:
 * The daguerreotype /dəˈɡɛrɵtaɪp/ (French: daguerréotype) process (also calleddaguerreotypy) was the first publicly announced photographic process[1] and the first to come into widespread use during the early 1840s. By the early 1860s, later processes which were less expensive and produced more easily viewed images had almost entirely replaced it. A small-scale revival of daguerreotypy among photographers interested in historical processes was increasingly apparent during the 1980s and 1990s and has persisted into the 2010s.

Pagan iconography in tombs was very hot for a period. They offset the Egyptians stuff with lots of biblical references.

The winding pathways are a Victorian influence, mostly designed for horse drawn carriages to meander through. Smaller pathways are increasingly being ripped up to make room for new graves. The premium for being buried in New York City is very high. Allison said your best bet for getting buried in NYC is to "go for" a paupers gave in a place like Hart Island.

Reading an epitaph to a dog. There are only 4 dogs buried in Green-wood as far as Allison knows.

Grave of William Holbrook Beard. He was found to be buried in Green-wood and only later given a jazzy headstone indicative of his artwork.

First casualty of the Civil War, 12 year old  drummer boy Clarence MacKenzie. His grave marker is zinc. Apparently, you could mail order these markers. They had interchangeable heads. The zinc holds up very well, which is why it looks so crisp and new.

The cemetery is considering banning the black stone because they think it's ugly.

*
The catacombs, which became a popular form of burial when people were afraid of being buried alive. Allison credits Edgar Allen Poe with much of that hysteria. That's poetry doing some cultural work. The idea was that if you woke up, you could make a bunch of noise in a catacomb and someone would hear you. 

*
As above, so below. Unusual reference for a grave.

Brooklyn-Queens Expressway
The BQE, part of Interstate 274, was constructed with the oversight of Robert Moses, reviled urban planner of mid-20th century New York. Completed in 1964, the BQE ripped through many residential neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens, uprooting small businesses and communities. The commemoration ceremony for the BQE happened near this site by Red Hook, one of the communities most devastated by the highway's construction. It was essentially cut off from the rest of the borough.

The Gowanus Canal
Recently designated a superfund site by the EPA, the Gowanus canal is an industrial waterway that is heavily polluted. 
*
From the EPA's archeological assessment of the site:

*
*
Artists Jeff Stark recently staged a play on the Gowanus called the Dreary Coast. 

 * "Just being on the water is a perspective-shifting experience, but at night among industrial maritime infrastructure it is positively surreal. While piloting the boat post-show to its nightly hiding place Stark asked, "You see the clearance we have on this bridge coming up?" We glided under the steel grate of the road deck with cars passing a couple feet overhead. "It was like nine inches earlier because of the tide," he said, showing how people had to duck down. "People flipped out; they loved it. When you hit those marks, the audience is like, Oh my god! I get it! You're not supposed to be here."" - City Lab from the Atlantic

The Lehigh Valley Barge in Red Hook
Railroad barges shuttled cargo to and from railroad cars and ships too large to dock where the railroads met the water. The waterways of New York were full of these and many other working vessels before containerization took hold. Containerization standardized the size and material of all freight transport so that the same containers that were used on trucks could also be stacked on ships. The railroads were passed over in favor of highways and the major ports in New York moved to New Jersey. 

The Lehigh Valley Barge Museum is a passion project of David Sharps, a juggler and performer who acquired the barge about 25 years ago. He hosts performances and educates the public about the history of the harbor.

The Red Hook Dry Rocks & Ikea
The Red Hook Dry Docks, completed in 1866, were some of the oldest and biggest on the east coast.

*
 * "This photograph features a dry dock that was part of Todd Shipyards in Red Hook. This image was taken to document the reopening of the dock, which had been expanded to a length of 730 feet and a total capacity of more than 15,000,000 gallons of water. "

A Dry Dock (or graving dock) is used to repair a ship. Fill it with water and float the boat in. Drain the water out and work on the bottom of the boat. After many years of waning business as shipped declined in the New York harbor and failed efforts to save the historic site, the dry dock and the rest of the ship yard around it were sold to Ikea in 2006. The docks were filled in and now rest under the Ikea parking lot and the park.
