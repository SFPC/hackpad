Claire's project stack 


 * 1. The Real Neo

* 

Idea:
 * Play on The Matrix/Baudrillard's theories on simulacra
 * Explore the hyperreality of pop culture / exaltation of culture icons 

Project:
 * Pepper's ghost of Keanu Reeves video collage (in small box?) – need to test quality in different sizes

To do:
 * Get materials to test best outcome (flat glass, lexan polycarbonate sheet, thinner plexiglass, grey scrim)
 * Edit video pieces – test speed of videos (slowed-down?) + if full body is more effective than cropped/close-ups (gaze)




 * 2. The Rules of Attraction

*

Idea:
 * Simulation of desire / disembodied intimacy
 * Disruption of fantasy
 * The death of romance (a theme from Bret Easton Ellis' The Rules of Attraction) explored through materializing the spatiality of a couple's initial meeting
 * Appropriating the scene from Romeo and Juliet (1996) – nostalgia/invented worlds as fascimile for the real
 * Explore the affective qualities of physical space

Project:
 * Two projected video feeds that allow the viewer to literally + physically walk through a scene of a movie. Videos react to location of the viewer, as if the actor's gaze was following the viewer. When there is no one in the space, they are looking at each other.

To do:
 * Figure out how to track heads/blobs in OF with the PS3 Eye, then put on Raspberry Pis
 * Build prototype of projections in space to see where the "gaze" of each video should land 


 * 3. Programming language (Amit's class)

Project:
 * Programming language assignment from Amit Pitaru's class
 * Hackpad: Parsed Poetry Programming Language with Moises Sanabria and Jason Levine and Jonathan Wohl

To do:
 * Finalize syntax and how IDE would work
 * Wireframe + design IDE
 * Name + brand + any other design needs?


 * 4. Control Structure Diorama (Zach's class)

Project:
 * Control Structure education tool from Zach Lieberman's class
 * Hackpad: Control Structures Metaphor with Jonathan Dahan

To do:
 * Get materials for diorama and build it



 * 5. Paradise (Pineapple) 
*

Idea:
 * Simulated paradise, in an object

Project:
 * A pineapple made up of mirrors. 

To do:
 * Find a 3D drawing of a pineapple and figure out how to fabricate



 * 6. Paradise (Zombie) 
**

Idea:
 * Simulated paradise, in the form of an infinite drink maker

Project:
 * Infinite drink maker, like a fountain. The zombie glass would empty out into a repository that feeds back into the drink shaker which would then shake the drink liquid up before pouring back into the glass.

To do:
 * Get materials: Glass, shaker, drink materials, motor?



 * 7. YOLO/FOMO


*
Idea:
 * Happy face / sad face

Project:
 * Rotating circular neon signs with YOLO or FOMO on top or bottom at any given time, dependent on up/down (in/out) see-saw action.

To do:
 * Fabricate neon signs
 * Figure out materials + tech


 * 8.  Paradise: Making it Rain


**


Idea:
 * 

Project:
 * Motorized fake hand that "makes it rain" money

To do:
 * Get fake hand
 * Prototype with motor


 * 9.  Lenna Masked (Analog Image Proccessing)

*


*


Idea:
 * Analog image processing of "standard Lenna" image

Project:
 * Printed out image of Lenna with printed out "masks" of her face
 * Masks could be on a motorized rotation

To do:
 * Print assets out
