I want Pi: OF on the Raspberry Pi

Equipment List
 * router
   * ethernet cables? or wifi?
 * For each participant:
   * RPi
   * Power Cable
   * WiFi
   * Pre-configured SD Card
   * Maybe:
     * Keyboard/mouse
     * Display

Workshop Outline
 * Introduce ourselves, help people get setup (?), gauge experience.
 * Intro to OF & Raspberry Pi
   * What is OF good at?
   * What is the Pi good at?
   * And with their forces combined...
 * Very Briefly walk through setup of Raspberry Pi
   * we won't be performing this setup during the workshop, but I think it's good to go through it with people so that there's no mystery.
   * describe difference between building in XCode and on pi (demonstrate make on Mac)
 * Describe workflow
   * Option A: SAMBA
     * Mount the Pi on your computer
     * If you're on a fast connection, edit the files directly
     * If the connection is slow, edit a copy then move it to the Pi
   * Option B: Git + SSH
     * Develop and test on your computer
     * Push working code to git repo
     * From SSH session
 * Walk through the osc skeleton code. Maybe we should build it together as a group since it's so simple, each one writing it individually?
 * Show a couple examples of ways it could be used.
 * Pair up participants, help them build something cool.
