Silent Barn Code Poetry Workshop
 * Culminates in performance -- 2 options:
   * Solo using just keyboard and either TTS or prerecorded voice audio, or just text on screen and music
   * Duo, working in pairs, one student rocks the mic while the other controls the visuals
 * Getting code from the kids options
   * Sheet of paper with what happens when you press different keys
     * i.e q { show "i'm cool" in front of picture of the ocean, play "beat1"}
   * barebones mousetrap.js files with a couple of sample lines of code such as
     * showText("this is the text", color=black) //text that auto-fits to the whole screen
     * say("say this") // speak through a text to speech library
     * playSound(soundFile) // plays a sound file
     * bgColor(color) // makes the background a certain color
     * showImage(imageFile) // changes background image to a certain image
     * showVideo(youtubeLink) //plays a fullscreen youtube video from a link
