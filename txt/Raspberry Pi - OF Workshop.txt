Raspberry Pi + OF Workshop
With Jason van Cleave

Today we are interfacing RPi, OF and linux. 

RP Specs:
 * has microcontroller features (GPIO)
 * GPU - OpenGL ES 2, OpenMax
 * RAM shared between GPU/CPU
 * Component/HDMI audio
 * Ethernet
 * GPI/O  - like arduino however it has less protection - it is possible to fry your board.
 * Need an additional chip to deal with analog inputs 

Github repository for OF that will run on the Raspberry Pi
 * https://github.com/openFrameworks-arm

 * If you want to do a 10 screen project - can use 10 Pis instead of 10 mac minis. 

OpenMax (OMX)
 * think of it like an openGL for accelerated video
 * provides hardware accelerated - video decoding, encoding, audio decoding, camera access
 * Allows 1080p playback
 * Large texture access (720p at full framerate)

CV
 * OpenCV is CPU bound so it will eventually hit the slower processor (can't run from the GPU only)

Textures - live in the GPU which is fast
 * Pixel access however requires the CPU - makes it much slower. 
 * Can get pixels from a texture but then it goes to CPU - and that makes it slow.

Cross-compiling
 * SLOW!
 * Workflow: Develop on the desktop and port to the Pi

Node also runs on the Pi

If you see .bin files it means that it has already been compiled.
