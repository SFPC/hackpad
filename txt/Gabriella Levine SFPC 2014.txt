 * Hardware and Technologist
 * Went to ITP where I met the community.
 * Have done a variety of installation work.
 * A lot of the work I do is bio inspired,come from bio research.
   * Biometric Design, taking cues from Biology
 * Use different algorithm to propagate motion.
 * Robotic snake
   * Looking at how snakes move and articulate
   * Figuring out how the wiring goes.
   * Trying to optimize the shape.
   * Different motions when the move through the water.
   * Wanted to have these snakes in the water collecting data but now focusing more on the motion.
   * Want to get to pint where I can make these cheaply and fast and start iterating on prototype.
