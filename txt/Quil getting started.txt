Install Leiningen
"Leiningen is the easiest way to use Clojure. "
You need to install it also to use Quil.
Official page 
Github

 * Copy the script from here and saved with a name "lein".
 * Then put on `/usr/bin/` folder on your Mac.  (make `$PATH` to `/usr/bin/`, means you can run lein by just type `lein` in Terminal)  
 * You may need to change the permission by `$ chmod 755 /usr/bin/lein`.  
 * Test with `$ lein -v`.  It shows a version if the install was successful

Make a Quil project

1. `$ lein new quil myapp`  //create a project
2. `$ cd myapp` //go inside the folder just created
3. `$ lein repl` //launch repl  
4. `user=> (require 'myapp.core :reload)` // *run the project  
*the location of the project is `src/myapp/core.clj` in this case.   
In repl, use `.` instead of `/` (not `myapp/core.clj` but `myapp.core`) 

*

There are many examples on github (https://github.com/quil/quil-examples). 
The tutorial on this page is helpful.
