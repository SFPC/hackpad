Nathan's Stuff
To Do:
 * populate this document.
**SOME THOUGHTS**
 * Story. Narrative. For any Sfpc project I do to feel meaningful to me, I'm going to need this. Be it a composition that feels like it has a beginning and an end, to a program, I'm going to need a story; to tell one! ...}else it's just rudiments and exercise (not that there is anything wrong with that, but I can do that at home).
**PROJECT IDEAS**
 * Waveform visualization program. Frequency dependent.
   *  could this plugin to Logic .ovm files for refining complex editing tasks?
   * could compression algo (mp3) be used to visualize important data in a waveform to make editing easier?
 * Spoken chess app for handsfree or blindfold chess. 
   *  API to integrate with chess.com?
   *  This has assistive potential
 * Music app
   *  an ableton  style app that allows you to click or record blocks of music snippets that you could record or play. This could be used for arranging song ideas or as a performance tool
   *  Arpeggiators as functions. 
   * Portable DAW/Kaossilator style music device. Sample environment, detect pitch, apply harmonic manipulations to create tones based on overtones. arpeggiate, instrument, synth, sampler
 * Program a miles an hour to minutes calculator
   * just seems an easy excersise. 
 * List/to-do app
   * ie Omnifocus, lifebalance style task management.
   * what would this look like if I made something customized for myself?
   * its something I've thought a lot about...
 * Camera app supporting notes.
   * why can't I append/tag my photos with notes when I take them? 
   * i.e. someone shows me a cool bird and tells me about it. I want to snap a picture. But i want the name of the bird with it and maybe a website etc. 
 * Program a web app for file sharing
   * a more elegant way of implementing this:
   * http://files.doghouseNYC.com 
 * I want to make something with a rotary phone. Why? I just do.  Because they are awesome. And pulse dialing is neat.
 * Use a lizard in a project. (partly because I have one). I'm only half joking. Maybe 4/5 joking. I think Beardo would enjoy being an installation.
 * VR Ping pong using iPhone camera. Could sound be implemented in a cool/musical way?
   * I imagine playing with someone else or against a wall (like handball)
     * bluetooth?
**Geez... COULDN'T ALMOST ANYTHING BE A LANGUAGE?**
 * Chess as language
 * the bouncing ball game with sound that I was thinking of. Language???
**SOME RANDOM QUESTIONS**
 * Ugh. Um...I just sorta need help.  I'm not exactly sure how to ask. It's partly that I (like everyone else) is overwhelmed. But I think it's a little beyond that. I don't want to overwhelm everyone else because I know everyone else is saturated as too. But I'm feeling like I'm struggling with basic stuff on every front and it's beginning to paralyze me.
   * maybe someone could spend time with me looking over my shoulder while I try to figure stuff out - just preventing me from spinning my wheels on the stupid stuff and helping me clarify my problem solving process.
 * How can I best maximize my existing assets and skills?
   * studio, creative/musical, business/project management, flexibility (knowing a little bit about a lot of things).
 * Are the processes of "DSP theory " and "learning to code" complimentary? Or is it a can of worms and I should hold off till later.
   * Is using Max a crutch/shortcut that I should avoid?
 * how do you deal (programmatically) with non graphical stuff?
   * ie. a database, or referencing a file?
 * How do you decide when is it more efficient to code simple scripts from scratch (for example: making an object in Unity clickable/draggable), or when is it best to use pre-existing libraries/tools?
 * What languages should I be learning?
 * How do I get shit onto my phone. I have the dev license... i think.
 * What are some ways that people like to approach "prototyping"?
**SHOULD I DO THESE WORKSHOPS?**
 * fuling creative process - creating/delivering on short notice
 * synth programming
 * chess as narrative/decision making/logic
 * making hot sauce. ...with bacon.
 * how music works (easy harmony/music theory/launchpad)
