Projects we're interested in creating

as we've been discussing final projects -- thought we could have a hackpad place to write out ideas and if anyone wants to pitch in with their thoughts or add resources, we can begin to do it here.


1. im thinking about a doll that when you hug it, it yells out at you for being republican. or you can upload your own message... or doll that reacts differently depending on where you touch it.

would like to find toy/doll makers who might be able to give me tips or to collaborate. if anyone has any leads on such a person in NYC, please get in touch! 

(rachel - please ask me to introduce you to yuri gittman / also Kaho Abe)
