OSX Terminal Student Workshop - 22/10

I would really like to know more about Terminal stuff, and I was wondering if we could organize a student workshop on this topic. Next wednesday 10/22 we have a free day and would be great to schedule it after lunch like the Git workshop.

Who's going to teach? Jonas Jongejan? Sarah GP?
Since Jonas is doing node, I am totally happy to teach

If anyone else is interested write your names here.
