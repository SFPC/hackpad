Expression Reactive Photo Booth

Projected image funfair photobooth - the participant's expression defines the expressions on the projected image. eg - when the participant smiles to have the photo taken then the projected faces all stick their tongues out.

In bed with our machines

Photographs of the class in bed with their laptops, phones, ipads etc

I need to find a clever way of taking this pic.. i can ask my roommate, but what if the laptop takes picture itself? 
It would be great if your roommate could do it - problem with the laptop taking the photo is that the laptop is not in the photo....

Lesson that is paid for in real-time dollar by dollar when the participant feels they have learnt something of value, 

i think this dollar to dollar learning will be more interesting if it's done in alternative currency. Hard currency will make it fee like teachers are strippers or beggars. 
I understand how you feel - but to me the direct link with the money is the most important thing - it is the way we assign value to things - giving money is something we do in thousands of situations - I am interested in why it feels culturally demeaning to be paid for something as you are doing it rather than in advance in anticipation of what you will recieve in return.
