Structure
 * Connect to your previous project, think about connections to the next project
 * ex: openframeworks <-> http <-> arduino <-> physical
 *  - those arrows, understanding how 2 of the layers communicate, means you know the key points of why
   * chat with Zach re: oF to web, web to arduino

 * spacebrew - http://docs.spacebrew.cc/gettingstarted/


workshops/classes
 * physical to virtual : arduino & C w/Taeyoon and Jonathan
   * explore the relationship between low level logic and how we express it in software
 * virtual to networked: making devices talk w/Zach and Jonathan
   * looking at the http protocol from a space & speed limited device, the goal is to show just how open networking and packets are - to not be afraid of inspecting raw feeds to learn how they work. You can be a hacker too!
 * networked to meaningful: communicating with humans w/Paul and Jonathan
   * how to turn data into something that makes you feel / understand?
   * the joys of animation?
