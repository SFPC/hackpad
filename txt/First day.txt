Workforce opportunity 

It was good talking with you as well. As promised I am attaching a few documents describing Workforce Opportunity Services’ mission and our work, and an interview with our founder.
Please note that our focus has primarily been on developing employer-driven workforce development for young adults, college graduates and military veterans. However we started a couple of new initiatives, one of which is to develop programs with partner organizations on providing enrichment and education for youth in the city. In addition, I am going to direct you to a few links from our Web site:
About our veterans’ initiatives: http://www.wforce.org/index.php/veterans/program-overview
About our ”In the Community initiative”: http://www.woscommunity.org/
 
I look forward to learning more about your work, especially your launch in Bushwick. In the meantime, I would like to mention my conversation to my colleagues here. Would you let me know what your full name is?
I believe you said that you were co-founder of the School, correct?
 
Thanks,
 
Daniella

ITP + SFPC Mixer 

School for Poetic Computation (http://sfpc.io) would like to invite ITP students and faculty for an ITP + SFPC Mixer on November 7th at SFPC's home: 155 Rivington Street.  This will be an opportunity to meet students from each other's schools and share what you have been working on. 

Inspired by open studio and LAN Party, we encourage students to bring a work in progress to the Mixer. There will be table and wall spaces to show small work in progress. It can be as simple as a laptop or sketchbook. (You can sign up for space here.) We hope this is a fun addition to our low-key social event — you are also welcome to come and just enjoy the party!

 * About SFPC
School for Poetic Computation is organized around exploring the creative and expressive nature of computational approaches to art and design. The school approaches writing code like creative writing — focusing on the mechanics of programming, the demystification of tools, and hacking the conventions of art-making with computation. The school aims to be more than a technical bootcamp. It is an opportunity to work intensively with a small group of students, faculty, and artists to explore questions about the poetics of computation. The school was co-founded by Zachary Lieberman, Taeyoon Choi, Amit Pitaru and Jen Lowe in 2013. The Fall 2014 session is run by Zachary Lieberman, Taeyoon Choi, Amit Pitaru, Tega Brain, Ramsey Nasser, Allison Burtch, and Ida Benedetto.
