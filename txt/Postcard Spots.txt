Postcard Spots

We have 250 postcards for the show to scatter across the city. Where should they go?

If there's a place you're going today or tomorrow, you can drop em off, otherwise just drop places on the list and I will just bike around. 

If you wanna grab cards for your friends, I'll leave them on the table next to the green bins.
