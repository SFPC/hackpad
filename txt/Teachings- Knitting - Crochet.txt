 * Heart 
 * To begin, Chain 2.
 * Row 1: 2 single crochet (sc) in second chain froom hook. Chain 1, turn.
 * Row 2: 2 sc in each stitch. Chain 1, turn.
 * Row 3: 2 sc in first stitch, 1 sc in next 2 stitches, 2sc in last stitch. Chain 1, turn.
 * Row 4: 2 sc in next sc, sc in next 4 sc, 2 sc in next sc.  Chain 1, turn.
 * Row 5: 2 sc in next sc, sc in next 6 sc, 2 sc in next sc.  turn (no chain).
 * Row 6: skip 2, (2 dc, 4 tr, 2 dc) in next sc, skip 1, sl st in next sc, skip 1, (2 dc, 4 tr, 2 dc) in next sc, skip 2, sl st in next sc.
 * To finish the hearts, slip the stitch down one side of the heart, approximately 6 slip stitches to the bottom. Chain 1 at the bottom of the heart, and slip stitch up the other side of the heart. Slip stitch to first chain of row 7.

Flower (2 colors)
   * To begin: Chain 7.
   * Connect the ends of the chain by using a slip stitch to connect your current stitch to the first stitch you made.
   * Chain 2.
   * Double crochet 11 stitches into the middle of the ring/circle you made in previous step. All stitches will go through middle hole of the ring/circle. (You should have 12 stitches in total around the ring/circle: the first 2 chains act as one double crochet.)
   * Connect first double crochet stitch to 12th double crochet stitch with a slip stitch. Cut, tie, and weave in ends.
   * Take your other color and do a slip stitch to get it onto your hook.
   * Insert your hook between 2 of the 12 double crochets and chain 2.
   * Triple crochet 2 more stitches into the same place.
   * Take your hook out of the current stitch's loop and put it through the top of your first 2 chains.
   * Take the tip of last triple crochet by grabbing it with your hook and pulling it through the top of the first two chains. (This makes the petal look a little bit 3D.)
   * Chain 2.
   * Double crochet 1 stitch into the next spot (between 2 double crochets) and then triple crochet 2 more. Repeat steps i-k.
   * Repeat step k for every spot around the ring/circle. 
   * When last petal has been made, connect to first petal using a slip stitch.
   * Cut, tie and weave in ends.
