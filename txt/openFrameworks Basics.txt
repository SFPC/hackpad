openFrameworks Basics 

Questions
 * How do I get started with OF?
 * Best way to structure files, especially if you are trying to put it on the Github and keep on updating?
 * How to Addon stuff?
 * Where and how can we find examples?
 * how to use, understand and navigate through the documentation

Notes:
 * How compiling works? 
 * Source code - Write text 
   * differene between cpp file and h file
     * h file - list of ingredient
     * cpp file - how to execute the ingredients (steps)
 * Pre-process
   * Taking the text and changing it 
     * "#" Take this file and modify it
     * Include guard so if the file sees "h" file twice, it won't freak out
       * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Include_guard
 * Compile
 * Link
   * Smashes all the code into one


documentation: 

use the prefix "of" to know what's going on
objects will have an of, like ofImage, ofPolyline, ofVideoPlayer but have function and variables that don't have OF as a prefix.  like: 

ofImage img;
img.draw();

other functions like in ofGraphics, such as ofRect, ofLine, ofCircle start with "of" as a prefix and don't require an object. 

examples are really your friend.
