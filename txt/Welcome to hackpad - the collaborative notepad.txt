Welcome to hackpad - the collaborative notepad

Hi all! This is a public, collaborative wiki that I'd like to try out for sharing things like resources, lesson plans, and works in progress. Let me know if you have questions: casey@sfpc.io

 * Create pads (by clicking the "+" button above) and invite people to them.  Once they arrive, you can edit in real-time.  Changes made when the other people aren't around are emailed to everyone.

 * It's easy to create bi-directionally linked pads.  Just type "@" and you can link to any pad or person - or create a new pad.  Give it a try!
   * Any people you mention using '@' linking will get automatically notified and invited.

 * type here to try it out

 * You can organize pads into collections on the right hand side menu, or you can put #hashtags directly into your notes that associate notes with eachother

 * You can create todo items like these by clicking on the checkbox button above.
   * Join hackpad

 * To access your pads on the go, just open this website on your iPhone or Android.

Have fun!
