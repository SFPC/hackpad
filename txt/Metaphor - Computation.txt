Metaphor + Computation

Homework from MA/AM class 1 - three things:

 * Find examples of work that you'd like to investigate and figure out how it's made. This was the original idea: "I like this stuff; how is it made?"

 * Add yourself to this Math helpers pad, and list any math you can help other people with:
 * Math helpers
 * 
 * Light + Metaphor + Computation*

Propose new art that connects light - in particular a Blink(1) - to computation, in order to create a metaphor.

The light can go anywhere in the world. The computation can be connected to the light in a lot of different ways: the light could show the results of the computation; the light could perform the computation; the light could go off and on at particular threshold values of the computation. Connect the light to computation to create / support your metaphor.

Make something to explain your artwork to everyone. Write. Draw. Design. Code. Perform. Slam... it's up to you.

*This borrows heavily from Golan Levin's Assignment-03-Blink, which you can read here, though it's not identical to our assignment:
