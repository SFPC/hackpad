Speculative history of computing

In addition to the basic concepts of Abstraction, Compression, Integration and Concretization, I will talk briefly about ENIAC as a starting point for a possibly different history of computing. (Decimal numbering system, Parallel communications,  Vacuum tubes, Patching, 
 
ENIAC

*
ENIAC was initially designed to calculate artillery firing tables for the United States Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory

*

*
That circuit contained a pair of "triodes"-three-element vacuum tubes-only one of which conducted current at any one time. When the circuit was triggered by an external pulse of current, each tube in it "flipped" into its opposite state: conducting or nonconducting. (H. J. Reich of the University of Illinois called the Eccles-Jordan circuit a "trigger" circuit in his writings, which were widely read. The IBM engineers working on electronic calculators in the 1940's remember the circuit by Reich's name; after the war the term flip-flop came into common use.)13

   * The man who is speaking in this video made this computer.
   * Most technology is first created for a military purpose.
     * Funding comes from it.
     * "Took less time to calculate this more than it took the actual missile to launch"
   * Most women we're programmers.
     * Part of the reason was because many of the men were in the army.
     * These women we're the best at their skillset, mathematicians etc. 
Flip-Flop 
*
*
The basic electronic memory device of the ENIAC is the flip-flop. A flip-flop consists essentially of a pair of triodes so connected that at any given time only one of the pair can be conducting. When a certain one of the tubes is conducting (and the other is not), the flip-flop is said to be in the normal state; when the other tube is conducting (and the first is not), the flip-flop is in the abnormal state. A flip-flop has two inputs and two outputs. A pulse received on one input (the set input), throws the flip-flop into the abnormal state in which state it remains until restored to the normal state by a pulse received at its second (or reset) input. When the flip-flop is in the normal state, one output is positive and the other negative. In the abnormal state, the polarity of its outputs is reversed.

   * Parallel Machine
     * Different Modules that can calculate at different times.
     * The great Brain
   * The precursor of the internet
     * Different modules in a network connecting tubes to one another.
   * In the 1946 version there was no memory.
   * Designed to imitate the operations of mechanical adding machines.
     * You have a technology coming from the past and you try to recreate in a contemporary medium.

To Think About
 * How can we think beyond the existing models of computers and their inherent politics?
 * How else could computers be in the world?
 * What are alternative criteria for computational design?
 * How could agency be distributed differently in our technological systems?

Speculative Design Exercise
 * Design an alternative GUI for an operating system based on a different set of visual metaphors to that of the desktop
 * Or, design an operating system that adopts a different set of metaphors based on a system other than that of war/military (ie instead of "execute," "command line," etc)
 * We encourage you to conceive of an alternative history that has led to the development of this alternative computer system. If war was not the driving force, what would there be instead? Does this position computation differently as to its role in our lives, our relationships with computers, our relationships together?
