Top down ideas
  Will always be diluted as being built
  The shell might be made by the end, but its not what you wanted
  Requried knowledge of whats possible in the medium

Bottom up ideas
  Don't know what the result will be, if it will be satisfactory
  Until you figure out what process/situation promotes the ideas that you find satisfactory, must be comfortable with ambiguity
