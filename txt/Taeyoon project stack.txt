I'd like to take everyone, including teachers, to take family photograph. it will be about 20 people.

Helping students 

Tega Brain 
*Tega wants to punch holes for sheet music.  The hole puncher is difficult to push.
To push linear motion with some torque use this stepper motor  
https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10848 
it holds great strength and delivers clean vertical movement. 
*

another option is to use specific device made for pushing. 
*
It's called Linear actuator. 
you will need to build bracket to hold motor and hole puncher to be aligned. Although you can build by wood, this may be a good thing to cut from laser or 3d print to save time.  

The best place to buy motors as such is http://www.servocity.com/ 

Andy Clymer
Andy would like to continue making circuit/ micro controller for sound performance. 
I'm packing together some material and info for you over the weekend. Let's build opamp and then some more stuff monday/tuesday? 

opamp not only gives superior control over amplifying sound signal (compared to single transistor: speaker driver we used) but also gives room for flexible distortion.

I'm hoping to help Andy make modular synths on Wed~Friday of next week. let me know if you want to join. 
There is much to cover and some prep on my side, so it will continue as short labs through out the last two weeks of sfpc.
I will clean my work bench today and report back what to start building.

some laser cut stuff with paper will be fun.

Le also wants to do stuff with microphone

contact mic, amplification, sound activated stuff 
*

(I have a bunch of gear -- contact mics, tube amps, mac sound card, let me know -- zach) ok cool. 

I just found five contact mics and few electret microphones in my box of sensors (including flex and force resistive: touch) I think these mics and sensors will be helpful for Le and Andy. 

Le's idea has to do with counting how many words people say. Low tech way of doing so will be 1. contact mic to throat of speaker (may not be pleasant) 2. using electret mic to feed into a microcontroller.

 black box: an opaque technological device for which only the 
inputs and outputs are known. !e black bloc: a tactic of anonymization 
and massi"cation often associated with the direct action wing of the left. 
Somehow these two things come together near the end of the twentieth 
century. Is there a reason for this?

Eyebeam space/ curatorial stuff

Paragraph for Eyebeam website
 
"More Poetry, Less Demos" - SFPC 

School for poetic computation, or SFPC, is an experimental education and research initiative in form of ten weeks learning environment, led by former Eyebeam fellows Zachary Lieberman and Taeyoon Choi with Amit Pitaru and Jen Lowe. From November 20-23 SFPC in partnership with Eyebeam Art & Technology Center will present SFPC: The First Class, a survey of unconventional learning process that happened in past ten weeks featuring fifteen artists from their first class.  

Through an open call, SFPC accepted fifteen individuals from diverse backgrounds and locations around the world. Since September 15th, they have occupied a sun light filled loft in downtown Brooklyn attending lectures and workshops, averaging days of 12 + hours/day together. Classes covered topics from basic electronics, programming, math as well as cooking and walking and more. Also weekly guest lectures and workshops were offered by by leading artists and technologists. Over a ten week period, these students have produced teaching tools, software and hardware, interventions and provocations that bring into question the poetics of computation and creative use of computational media.   

For SFPC: The First Class, fifteen students will continue their learning, collaboration and prototyping at the main exhibition space of Eyebeam for the last week
of the ten weeks program. Eyebeam will be transformed into a hybrid space of classroom, studio and an exhibition for work in progress and documentation from classes. Participating artist Simona De Rosa, Le Wei, Jonathan Dahan, Claire Lin, Moises Sanabria, Ishac Bertran, Mini Kim, Andy Clymer, Jonathan Wohl, Rachel Uwa, Paul Cheng, Jason Levine, Motoi Shimizu, Jessica Wolpert and Tega Brain will be present at Eyebeam to continue to work throughout the week. SFPC: The First class will be open to the public from November 20 - 23, as an open classroom for the wider New York community to glimpse an unconventional learning process led by the first class. There will be a public reception on the evening of Friday November 22, 6~8:30 pm and participatory workshop and discussion on Saturday November 23, 1~5 pm.
    





 






<SFPC: The First Class> is a survey of the ideas exchanged at the school and an invitation for the wider New York community to glimpse an unconventional learning process initiated by this first class. Exhibition of work in progress, documentation from classes as well as workshops for the public will be presented at Eyebeam Art and Technology Center from November 20th til 23rd.

Spinning Beach ball 
*

Spinning beach ball in real life. 
Print beach ball on cardboard, attach to servo motor (hacked to rotate 360 degrees) or stepper motor (unipolar/ unidirectional) Make the beach ball rotate when my work load becomes intensive, when I get stressed out, when I'm overwhelmed. Make the ball disappear when everything is functioning properly. 

I can't really do this because this dude Jack made it already.

or real inflatable beach ball that rotates around. 
hm i don't really wanna do this because this dude Damien made similar thing

*
hey Moises Sanabria can you give me some help on making this funnier?

Portraits of the first class 
portraits of sfpc the first class in hardware: it must be not face or portrait based on photographic image. but something tangible. like movement. gesture. smell
. it can be made of clay, electronics, felt, or something very simple to fabricate.
maybe something that everyone can take home after the school. somehow things which can be networked, like avatar. Finger puppets?
