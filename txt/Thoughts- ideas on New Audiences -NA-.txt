Thoughts, ideas on New Audiences (NA)
How do you understand the idea of NA?
 * Populations who are generally not thought of as potential costumers by the tech industry
 * People with specific needs that may not be target of fast-growing business models
 * 

What are some population groups we can think of as NA?
 * Elderly people
 * Youth
 * People with sensorial impairments / motor disabilities / developmental disabilities (how does this relate to Assistive Technology?)
 * Inmates
 * Population in socioeconomic disadvantage (low income, undocumented immigrants, etc)
 * ...


What are some ideas we could explore in this track?
 * In my experience, people who considered themselves more technical were afraid of language, writing, etc. (I know I'm probably making a huge generalization...) and visa versa. It may be interesting to look at this group as a new audience and help them understand language using something they're familiar with - technology. I think in Ramsey's class where we played with the idea of writing our own languages sort of demonstrated the opposite direction - people who are more familiar with language, writing, etc. may enjoy this entry into the tech space.
 * My understanding of the new audiences track encompasses people and groups that many never build technology themselves or care about how computation works, but could benefit greatly from directly interfacing with computational tools. My favorite example of this is 596 Acres, a non-profit that mashes up data from the city to figure out what abandoned lots are publicly owned. Sorting this information out is actually pretty cumbersome. 596 Acres does that work and helps communities gain access to those lots, usually to create community gardens. The new audience in this case are the communities who owns the benefits of the work done through creative computation. - Ida Benedetto
