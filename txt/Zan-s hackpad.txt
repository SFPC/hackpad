Zan's hackpad


blog: Many of my ideas/reflections/responses are on my sfpc blog, where I'm trying to post daily.  It's here: sfpc.zanarmstrong.com

In thinking about how to make the most of the next 6 weeks, I'd  like to make something that's interactive outside of the computer (but  powered by the computer).  A lot of Zach's work seems to play with the  ideas: Messa di Voce in which voice creates images, EyeWriter in which  eye movement becomes projected graffiti, Drawn for animating drawings  through touch, NightLights, etc.  And, it seems magical :). I also fell  in love with Emily & Theo's work at Eyeo two years ago.  My favorite  was Weather Worlds, but I also loved how they played with skateboard  movement and turned the computer inside out to use the iPad as a window  with the John Lennon project.  The Parade Project also seemed pretty  fantastic.  These works seem so wonderfully playful, feel magical, and  seem to create much more naturally human ways to interact with the power  of computers.  But, I feel like I don't know where to start to look  behind the curtain and join the adventure :).  

I'm not sure what  I want to make yet.  But, I'd like to start working on some smaller  projects that would move me towards this... or help me start playing  with these ideas.
