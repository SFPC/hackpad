Circuit and Drawing
Jonathan Dahan x Taeyoon Choi
*
*
 * Talking in small groups and as a whole about these questions.
   * What is a computer?
   * Draw a diagram of how a computer works.
     * When you are making software
     * What happens in your computer when you are looking at facebook?
 * This is how I would have drawn a computer 4 years ago.
**
 * This is how I would draw a computer now.

Von Neuman Architecture
 * The unit for storing data and the units for storing instructions can be in the same place.
*



 * What we're commonalities between the groups in how you drew how your computer works.
   * CPU and Memory are talking to each other quite often.
   * When you hit the key what is happening to the input to translate into pixels, binary.
   * It is from us the things we need from it.
   * Power oriented - map (battery)
   * Drawn Boxes
 * CPU and Memory are so entwined in how software works.
 * What happens when you create an html file.
   * The life cycle of his html file.
 * George Perec's Book
   * A story of apt buildings according to different rooms.
   * A story about a computer told from the point of view of different 
   * When I ask an electric computer engineer what a computer is he will talk about electrons.
 * A comparison with a vending machine where the input is the coin.
   * Execute the snickers program => output is the food product.
   * Think of all the products in the vending machine as memory.
   * Pay your computer to do something.
   * Feed the computer power.
Instruction-less Computing
   * Load the memory but it doesn't say execute.
   * Instruction-less computing: Doing stuff with a CPU without actually executing instructions
     * http://www.schrankmonster.de/2013/11/04/instruction-less-computing-stuff-cpu-executing-instructions/
   * Its weird to be typing into a void.

*
   * Trying to see if the guy could be ALU and the other hand is the bus.
   * Register
     * Short term memory
     * Copy data for a bit of time
     * Shift registers and flip flops
     * Latch that you lock the door the enables the computers to remember.
   * Act of Cooking is control unit + ALU
     * Remembering ordred => memory
     * Getting food  => output
 * Memory
   * RAM, CPU
     * Has its own cash
     * Think of these as interchangeable.
     * The only reason we have so many versions of memory is price tradeoff
       * If it was cheap to make chance which is in your CPU we wouldn't have hard-drives.
     * From a software point of view you are accessing these abstracted.
     * Someone made the decisions where the data gets saved.
 * Large Computer
   * When computers where as big as size of rooms where did things get stored.
   * Early storage - punch cards where the programs that you were telling it to write.
     * Three dimensional abacus
*
 * Clock
   * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_clock
   * What makes all this works is a clock.
   * A clock is a crystal.
     * Oscillates at some frequency, when it hits this crystal and the light goes through.
     * Every time a signal hits one of these to it is how the control unit decides to do something.
     * 
   * Now clocks are silicon.
 * Calculator and Computer
   * This ability to describe information its what makes it different form mechanical computers.
   * Human supplements the mechanical computer.
     * Someone who is good at simple math.
     * Who is computer is it a she.
     * Ada lovelace
       * *
     * Bruce Sterling
       * Difference Engine
         * What if the difference Machine was completed
 * Alternative history of computer.
   * Ballistic Research, trying to calculate if they could launch projectiles across a distance.
   * Then Electronics and silicon valley and Bell Labs.
Queer Computing
 * Jacob Gaboury
   * Turing was gay
   * Other companions that were secretly gay.
   * What are other ways computer could have gone if he completed his projects.
 * Bret Victor

   * Talking about the future as if he was a time traveler from the 70s.

 * Why is analog computer more poetic or interesting than silicon.
   * There is no really wrong answer, glitches are more celebrated here.
   * Is object oriented programming similar to modular computer.
   * You give up control.
   * Free form experiment.
   * Layers of discovery.
   * Nostalgia for Materiality.
   * Appeal in restricting choices.
   * Digital input and output could be as effective.
   * direct manipulation of data (signal), low level of abstraction 
 * Why do people now have a retro active view.
   * Grew-up on cds, there is streaming, but we go back to vinyls.
   * Photoshop => go back to photography
 * Very few languages 
   * the uncertainty tools of software are controlled by us.

 * What led you to start your inquiry to know how a computer works.
   * Using Arduinos how a computer works.
   * Burned Arduinos because I didn't understand how it works.
   * Friends were suggesting that you can do a lot with very little.
*

 * At the end of this week you should be able to make something like this.
   * 1 bit computer using 2 Nand gate chips.
   * Will take about 4 or 5 hours to make.
 * Jonathan Dahan Workshops
   * Depending on how experience the group is we can decide on the project.
 * Gabriella Levine will be here tomorrow.
   * She builds aquatic robots
 * Becky Stern
