Google Street Sound
Walk around in NYC with sound (by controling accelerator)
idea 
I think that the sound in NYC is characteristic to me. I mean there are sounds of taxi, people talking, subway.....
I always imagine that I can walk around with characteristic sound in NY
*

1 record sound in NYC with location data
2 put sound data to oF project
3 explore NYC by controling the device which sends location
4 you can hear any sounds depending on your location.

things to use for this project
it's kind of similar to previous project.
 * openframeworks
 * arduino?
necessary knowledge to get done this work and questions
 * how to record sounds including location data
input
 * iphone(accelerometer)
 * arduino(accelerometer)
output
 * sound from iphone
*
this is version 1. it really hard to collect so many sounds in 3 days. i think i should forcus on more specific area, like around sfpc or subway(cirtain stations)
<core stuff i want to do>
 * change volume by accelemeter
 *  generate sound file of hitory your walk
 * comunicate with ipad app and osx app for visualize your location and volume of sounds
<.farther>
 * use opengl
 * indicate your location on actual map with light (pen) by arduino
