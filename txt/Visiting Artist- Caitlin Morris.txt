Session 1, Intro to Arduino:

- anatomy of the arduino
- anatomy of the sketch

making an LED blink: digitalWrite HIGH and LOW

Serial library + serial communication

Serial = one thing after the other (one bit after the next, one at a time)

single bit = 0 or 1
1024 bits = 1 kilobyte (KB)

Baud rate = bits per second = serial "frequency"

Serial.println("Hello world!");

Digital read / write - will also be binary (1 or 0) -- use a pushbutton

Analog read - ADC analog-digital converter chip on pins A0-A5
use a photoresistor / light sensor - this will convert the resistance coming in to a value between 0 and 1KB, or 0 and 1023
** delay as a clearing tool - delay 5 or 10 ms between loops for the converter to settle / clear

Serial.println(incoming value)

Convert incoming value to an outgoing value

PWM (pulse width modulation) - on pwm pins

map()
