   * Out joy is in the teaching and making of communities.

 * What is the best way to power wearable if you are designing for people who are non technical?
   * Have a whole session on battery.

 * Has it happened where a company uses your examples and code in a product without crediting? #question
   * Its okay to use our code we just want people to know that it is our code.
   * We want to protect our trademark.
   * People would clone our design and make cheaper price.
   * Creative people building of our design.
 * Physical Presence
   * Rarely have a booth or physical presence at MakerFaire.
   * Spent inside and do our stuff where we can reach more people.
   * Workshops takes more effort and impacts lets people.
   * Tend to be very selective.
   * Hackers on Planet earth.

 * Autodesk bought Instructables for a couple of million dollars.
   * Software to manage shipping.
   * Don't buy commercial software so much.
   * If you are good at programming why would you buy a software that doesn't do what you really want.
 * New Website

Origin Story Adafruit
 * Limor Fried - College Dorm Room making cool experiments.
   * Things that people want to make.
   * Has a good spidey sense about things that want to be popular.
   * Example: Internet of Things.

 * Horror stories about what it took to get to the core values of Adafruit.
   * Saying yes to things you regret later.
   * By enacting those values so consistently.

 * How do you want these wearable future to be.
   * Wearables devices that they want you to wear all the time.
     * Fibit, Nike Fuel Band.
       * Augment your experience invisibly, have that data be part of your being.
   * Like the opposite.
     * Not make technologies that are invisible.
 * Human powered Carnival
 * How to keep staying in task with one project.
   * Ping pong between different parts of the project.
   * A job conducive to this workflow.
 * The idea that there will be different ways to interface with hardware.

If This Then That
 * https://ifttt.com/
 * Good for non programmers.
 * Can interface with many things.
 * Lets you prototype stuff really easy.

 * how do you stop yourself from working on the different projects? #question
   * Managing your own enthusiasm is really hard.
   * I have 18 million work hobbies.

3D Thursday 
Raspberry Pi Friday

 * Are there other things like the makey makey that are useful for super rapid prototyping.
   * Could turn any arduino into a makey makey if you use their code.
   * Adafruit leraning system.

Implementing your own tools
 * There are infrastructure questions where you don't know how everything works.
 * You can't rely on a single service.
 * Economies of scale that can be so big that they control everything.
