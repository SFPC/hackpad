Comments
 * we need to make Gluten free option as well as veggie option. 
   * Any suggestion? :) 
   * ddukboki will have gluten as well as pancake. so simple bibimbap with rice+veggie+meet will work for Jen. 
   * Veggie option may work with bibimbap with no meat. I know I said i don't wanna do bibimbap because of chopping, but i see it will be the best way. 
   * I like making bibimbob. Not too bad and I make pretty good one.
//I'm sorry but I can't go pick up grocery thursday. I have to teach at friends class in ITP in the morning and Circuit class in the afternoon. Can we schedule delivery? or can you ask someone to help you pick things up from K-town? It should be easy subway ride to 33 flatbush. 

//No problem. How do we get it delivered? Is it easy? or I can get it.
