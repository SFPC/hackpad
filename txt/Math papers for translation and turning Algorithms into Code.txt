Math papers for translation and turning Algorithms into Code


De Casteljau's Algorithm
 * How could I go from something I find like De Castlejau's algorithm, into code?
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Casteljau's_algorithm
 * This specific algorithm I've already found in Python so I'm all set, but where would I even begin if I couldn't find a code sample?
 * If I were to self-learn, what area(s) of math would I need to be comfortable with to work with an algorithm like this?
