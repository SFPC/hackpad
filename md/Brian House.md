*   How do we talk about Raw Data
*   [](http://github.com/brainhouse.braid)[http://github.com/brainhouse.braid](http://github.com/brainhouse.braid)

    *   Really like making my own libraries and web servers for things.

*   Think it terms that make sense to you

        *   Create you own language of building things.
    *   Lets you make perverse tools

*   One thing about sound is that it tends to be expensive.
*   Sound is less define than other modes of working.
*   Idea of the School

        *   Poetry, interpretation

                *   come up with those things and not let them be define by the raw data.

    *   Machine Learning in that Loop
    *   Data Science models it from a Behavioral mode.

                *   doesn't assume intention.

## Sound Pieces

*   **Recording my Rythms Piece**

        *   Sound Artist not a Musician
    *   Capital "M" Music
    *   What is that distinction what is sound what is Music
    *   John Cage deconstructing sound
    *   Dealing with it as an object.
    *   With super colider you start with a synthesis.
    *   Layer of interpretation in music.

                *   Rhythms
        *   Pattern

        *   Music is about everyday life.
    *   Who you are and what you experience is reflected in the types of music you've create.
    *   You experience everyday life in a certain meter
    *   Recording my:

                *   Breathing
        *   Heartrate
        *   Footsteps
        *   Polyrythm
        *   and that changes.

        *   Reperform this data as a musician.
    *   Created an interface kind of like Rockband.
    *   Working at NY R&D Lab
    *   Bedstey => Timesquare
    *   Fundamental Way in which I relate to the city.
    *   This became a way to document the experience.
    *   What was at stake in that translation from body to data to another body.
    *   Was I true to the data?
    *   Compositional Choice that makes it more readable as music.
    *   Level of interpretation is not any less accurate in a way.
    *   People might not relate to that as music.
    *   We think of data as being objective representing a truth.
    *   How are you measuring it, representing it.
    *   And it has political cultural ramifications.

*   **The Record Project**

        *   Its context awareness, trying to guess results before you even search them.
    *   Moving from data collection to anticipations.
    *   Google tries to inpersonate you to you.
    *   I think everyone should totally make a record out of their own data.
    *   Certainly with this kind of quantified self stuff there are all sorts of dimensions that you record.
    *   Its a question of meaning and want you want to express with it.
    *   There are materials that we can play with as artist coming from a commercial product.
    *   What if I made a record where one rotation was one day, 365 rotatoin was about 11 minutes.

                *   1.8 seconds per day
        *   Compressed your daily patterns to that level you can hear this things that repete.
        *   Becomes a musical motif.
        *   Its not a raw data.
        *   Taking out the transportation, only most common and most often.
        *   Assigned a musical interval to each of those.

        *   Cut individual records on a Layth.

                *   Its a clock record where you can tell where I am and what time it is.
        *   The physicality of the vinyl became important to me.
        *   Having this tactile and musical relationship with a physical thing.

                        *   Its still Data so what is at stake when you turn it into analogue.
            *   Data Mining NSA, this same data is understood in corporate significance and monetary value.
            *   Patterns of conformity and nonconformity.

        *   Friendly affective relationship to data.
    *   Haven't sold it yet just showing it around at different places
    *   Don't want to separate it from the record (!mp3)
    *   Making it a record is an eclectitable object.
