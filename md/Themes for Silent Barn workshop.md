*   Themes for Silent Barn workshop

**Proposition: **

We would like to propose to Silent Barn, considering our schedule and resource, it will be best to hold Poetic Science Fair at Silent Barn on 11.23 Sunday 1~6pm, for one day only. I think having a concentrated amount of time in single day will be much easier to get volunteer from SFPC and community, better chance of youth and community turn out to Silent Barn.  As you can see in the schedule, there will be multiple workshops happening concurrently around the main space. Another new idea that we'd like to propose is an exhibition of participants work at Silent Barn after the workshop. Many of the workshop contents can be collected to make a giant map of the neighborhood. While details of the workshop and exhibition is yet to be determined over the course of this week, we want to check if it is a possibility to use the storefront window to display some of SFPC and youth outcome from the Poetic Science Fair. 

**Short description for the web **

School for Poetic Computation ([](http://sfpc.io))[http://sfpc.io](http://sfpc.io/)) presents Poetic Science Fair, a one day event to learn about technology and storytelling. Middle and high school students are invited to design robots, make sound map of the neighborhood, make light up jewelry, play card games and teach computers to perform poetry. 

Your creations will be on display at Silent Barn!  

Poetic Science Fair is open to the public, for anyone interested in open source technology, arts and craft, and music and sound.  SFPC is a unique school for artists and engineers with professional experience to continue learning and pursue a creative practice in a supportive environment. You can experience the learning that happens at SFPC and meet members of the community. 

This event will be hosted at Silent Barn, an independent art and music space in Bushwick, Brooklyn. All workshops are free for youth under 18 years old and $10 suggested donation for adults. Snacks will be provided at 5pm. 

**Description **

[Title" "Code Poetry Jam"](/Toddpad-TEF4LqfiiPC) 

Artist: Todd Anderson 

Times: 3pm, 5pm 

Length:  Now thinking of doing 15-30 min segments people can drop in and out of

Sign up: No advanced sign up, just walk up to the table. (2-6 people/groups simultaneously).

Task: Use code and a wireless keyboard to make an audio-visual poetry machine that will continue to live on the internet!

**Things I need**

*   x computers (keyboard/ mice etc)
*   Either a large monitor or projector for displaying student projects

Where x is the number of people / groups i would be teaching simultaneously. I could do x= 2 or 3 by myself, or up to 6
<ul class="comment"><li>moving details to comment </li>
<li>Culminates in performance -- 2 options:<ul class="comment"><li>Solo using just keyboard and either TTS or prerecorded voice audio, or just text on screen and music</li>
<li>Duo, working in pairs, one student rocks the mic while the other controls the visuals</li></ul class="comment">
</li>
<li>Getting code from the kids options

*   like the title!  I have some ideas to contribute to the project, and can also help on site. put me on board. 

**Title: "Listen Up, It's Bushwick!"**

Artist: Zachary Dunham, Ida Benedetto, Taeyoon Choi      

Time: 1pm 

Length: 2 hours

Sign up: 7 people, Open to middle school and high school students. 

Task: Record and map sounds from the neighborhood to create a collective sound installation at Silent Barn. 

-z's thoughts:

What does it mean to listen to sound?  

What are the sounds around us?  Which ones do we forget about? 

*   Listen to some field recordings
*   sound / microphone overview
*   favorite field recordings 
*   playback ice, contact microphone recordings 
*   map making
*   senses, how we experience sounds ears, skin -> emotion

logistics 

*   how many students total? hopefully 7 kids doing 2 recordings // maybe run 2 sessions, in case 4 kids show up for each session? 
*   ideally we're getting somewhere around 20 recordings 

questions

*   bushwick boundaries (who to ask about this) // ellie irons? 
*   how to playback and listen on the spot //getting a dozen of dumb phones on ebay and hacking audio line out?  Joe McKay style hack?  [](http://joemckaystudio.com/cellphones.php)http://joemckaystudio.com/cellphones.php 

*   i was thinking it'd be easier to just tote the small speakers along for playback.   

*   What do we hear around the neighborhood? What does this (point to map) place sound like? What sounds do you hear every day here that you don't hear in other places? Who/what makes those sounds? 

breakdown 

*   1:00 - 1:15 talk about sounds, maps, listening 
*   1:15 - 1:20 place pins on "the map"
*   1:20 - 2:15 walk around, make recordings 
*   2:15 - 3:00 return to silent barn, assemble our auditory map and share with friends! 

z to do: 

*   email daniel fishkin / lucas re: bushwick demarcations, interesting locations
*   look into recorders 
*   find appropriate speakers 
*   brainstorm other materials 
*   assemble sounds and slides for talking about sounds

**Questions for recordists**:   

What are three sounds you want to record in the neighborhood?  

Where will you find those sounds?  

What is special about these sounds?  What do they mean to you?  

**+ **

**Some sounds facts** 

*   Sound travels hemispherically, like a ball growing larger and larger in all directions
*   Sound travels through the air in waves of compression, like a spring! 
*   Us humans can't hear low pitch sounds or high pitch sounds as well as other animals.  We hear speech frequencies best.  
*   The outer ear collects and directs sound into the inner ear. They're shaped to helps us locate and detect the direction of sounds.

**Poetic Science Fair **

kid-parent-family friendly title

stations and walk in visitors

From Kunal's email: "Meanwhile, I'll work on getting "Paesthetics" to work together with this group on co-presenting something like a Poetic Science Fair."

*   paesthetics is the legal entity of the Silent Barn

From Alexandra's email: "I love love loved the Poetic Science Fair name. Looking forward to hearing more from SFPC! In the meantime, I'll get in touch with Jaz/ELM for the kids' involvement."

**November 3rd meeting **

Lauren's ideas: LED throwies

Yuki's ideas: LED pin for girls

Todd's ideas: keyboard mapping sound,text to program. spoken word performance. paper and pencil exercise 

Ida's ideas: Silent barn as a toy, object. Mapping and pyschogeography 

 Taeyoon's idea: food, snacks and drinks for the event. 1~2K total budget. 

ARS telephone : ITP class [](http://itp.nyu.edu/~sve204/redial/)http://itp.nyu.edu/~sve204/redial/  

**Stuff to get/ Bring to Silent Barn **

Borrow computer monitors from Gary or somewhere.

Raspberry Pi or small computers

Keyboard and mouse 

Soldering stations and part bins 

SFPC sticker: to make before 

Small cardboard boxes that students can bring their projects home 

Power tools for installing the maps on walls

**Schedule **

11.22  

Sound Mapping workshop 1~4pm 

Code Poetry workshop 1~4pm 

*   Each workshop for maximum of 10 participants. 

11.23 Fair  

Poetic Science Fair (various workshops and experiences) 1~4pm 

Code Poetry Jam 4~5pm 

**Next step: Create a meeting discussion time to further flesh out this experience.  Meeting should include Ida if possible.  Then talk with Silent Barn.**

**Conversation with Ida =** Who decides the topic?  What do they want? (Silent Barn / Community)  Start by asking silent barn what they want to see.Does silent barn need to learn something about the community?  What are their ethics and expectations?

What's the "gift."  -- keep it simple

**Some working themes **

Digital Image Manipulation - Portraits  (photo booth, moving pixels, etc.)

Machine Intelligence : Projects around autonomy

sound making - sw/hw   -- I like this one!

recording - sound, images, patterns in the neighborhood.  analog data vis.  

binary game, foundation- 

storytelling - with alice/ game--- 

cardboard computer - giant circuit, instrument, paper computer 

how to balance low level stuff with higher level

Why we do this? 

*   new audiences, outreach, 
*   something different from Maker movement, Hackerspace culture  

**Possible Structure: **

Students rotate through "stations" each of which is different but feeds a central theme.  Mix of hardware, software, drawing, conceptualization/design, theory

In addition have a central "work zone"

*   wondering about the hardware stuff. If we decide on a circuit to make, would it be better to get small batch of pcbs made and then people can assemble them as kits as opposed to making circuits on perf board?
