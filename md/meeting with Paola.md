# meeting with Paola 

Who wants to meet with Paola tomorrow morning? 

We will meet with Paola around 10:30 AM and look around exhibition in the morning. come back to sfpc before 1pm for Lunch Talk with Dan Phiffer. 

Purpose of the meeting is for you to meet her and connect. I think she mentioned she will be away during our final show, so if you have some projects you want to show her, maybe you can mention to her and let her know in the future. If you have some questions, use this pad to gather thoughts.
