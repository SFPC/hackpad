# Python Workshop

I (Andy) would like to offer to teach a Python introduction. I learned Python in an appliation called DrawBot which is an environment for making some fun (and useful) drawings, but I'dl ike to open it up to other uses for Python. Maybe they include:

— Processing text with Python

— Organzing some raw data for another use
