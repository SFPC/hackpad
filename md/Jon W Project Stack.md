**power of violence**

Use violence to generate electricity.  Interactive performance?  A baseball bat is used to pummel some surface or object that converts the kinetic energy into electricity.

*   piezoelectric?
*   wind-turbine?

ha! interesting. how can you define violence? at what point does force becomes violent? when it starts to hurt? when it's unnecessarily applied?

related, I can ask what tech they used: [](http://ciid.dk/education/portfolio/idp09/courses/performative-design/projects/cop-suit/)http://ciid.dk/education/portfolio/idp09/courses/performative-design/projects/cop-suit/

**Uncle Harold Teaches God about Control Structures**

A story with watercolors that attempts to explain control structures to a pre-adolescent God.

initial, incomplete draft: [](https://github.com/jmwohl/sfpc/blob/master/Homework/L2L/Uncle%20Harold%20Teaches%20God%20Control%20Structures.md)[https://github.com/jmwohl/sfpc/blob/master/Homework/L2L/Uncle%20Harold%20Teaches%20God%20Control%20Structures.md](https://github.com/jmwohl/sfpc/blob/master/Homework/L2L/Uncle%20Harold%20Teaches%20God%20Control%20Structures.md)

this is great,

**While you were sleeping...**

**v1**. Create a pillow that sings a gentle lullaby, using as sonic material whatever information can be captured about any processes that continue within the computer while it is 'sleeping.'

**v2**. Detect when the computer goes to sleep and when it wakes, and create a report of events that have occurred in the 'real' world during that period of time.  Submit the report as a formal memo back to the computer, as though submitting a report to your boss.

**v3**. Choose your favorite picture book, and read several pages of it to your computer before putting it to sleep.  Make sure to show the computer the pictures.  Write a program that hooks into the 'going to sleep' event, generating a collage of these pictures just as the computer is passing out.  Maybe mix into the collage some data gathered from processes running shortly before the computer goes to sleep.

nice. this reminds of

**Audio virus**

Try to write a software program that transmits itself via computer's speakers/microphone.

Holy crap?

(I am super skeptical of this article, it comes without any recorded evidence of the phenomenon and reads really awkwardly -- I think the data rates for audio are very low...  I'm sure there's a ton of work being done on device level malware / firmware, etc but I read this article with a lot of skepticism....)   At any rate,  love the idea of audio communication as part of the process of sending a program, could be really interesting.

Yeah, of course â€” it's mostly the idea that I like.  Seems like it's pretty much only the one crazy paranoid guy...  But yeah, fun to think about, and attempt!

I really like this.. It reminds me of how some human disease propagates. The ebola virus causes the victim to sneeze as a way of getting air borne and finding new hosts. Its kinda like that - one computer needs to be in the hearing distance of another. But (thinking out loud) the microphone needs to be active I suppose - like maybe during a skype call?

**Delta**

This piece captures all of my incoming personal communications, and acts as a simple counting mechanism.  A mobile device displaying the count is placed between the jaws of a small vise, the handle of which is geared down substantially, with the final gear-shaft attached to a winch.  Every time an incoming communication arrives, a solenoid fires, ratcheting the winch one notch, effectively tightening the vise_ ever so slightly._  If enough communication arrives, there is a real danger that the vise will crush the device.

**Notes:** As active members of society, we increasingly depend on screens to navigate our existence.  A large portion of our daily communication makes its way to us or is pushed out from us through a screen.  It is becoming ever more difficult to spend time away from our screens, for it is through these gleaming portals that we are delivered the scripts by which we enact our lives.

Along with so many aspects of contemporary culture, artwork is moving from the enclosed spaces of galleries and museums to the controls of the pixel and the packet. ;) ;)

**Shoot**

A yearly re-enactment of Chris Burden's 'Shoot.'  Instead of shooting the artist, use as a stand-in whatever technology is considered to be the pinnacle of artificial intelligence.  Continue annually until forced to stop, either by substantial protest or by law.

**Markets**

Train a cascade classifier (the technique used to find faces in photos) to find backs of peoples head.  Using both the face and back-of-the-head classifiers, show a live feed from a camera in a public space with a heads up display that places ads next to detected faces and a target over backs of heads.
