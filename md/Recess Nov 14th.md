# Recess Nov 14th

**Siempre Verde Community Garden**

The East Village and Lower East Side have a vibrant community garden movement. Much of this activity [dates from the 1970s](http://www.nycgovparks.org/about/history/community-gardens/movement), where large parts of the city were abandoned and derelict following economic recession. The Lower East Side was one such place where old tenement buildings were abandoned, fostering the [squat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-Squat) and [punk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_No_Rio) rock movements.  

The [Siempre Verde](http://svgarden.org/) Community Garden is a newer addition to the LES gardening community. It consists of three tax lots, two of which are public access land and one of which the gardeners trespass on. [They have fought developer attempts to build housing on the land](http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2014/10/15/les_board_votes_to_save_garden_reject_new_development.php). 

The gardeners got organized with the help of [596acres.org](http://596acres.org/), an endeavor started in Brooklyn, where 596 acres of land were found to be unused publicly accessible land. 596 Acres identifies this land with street level signage and a website with a map and information about each piece of land. The websites allows people to register their interest in a particular parcel of land. When enough people show interest, 596 Acres helps them organize in person meetings so they can begin the process of getting access and using the land.

In the case of Siempre Verde, the publicly accessible lots had been given to the [Housing Preservation Department](http://www.nyc.gov/html/hpd/html/home/home.shtml) (HPD) in 1980 in a large move of abandoned buildings to city ownership. They are currently held by HPD, which means they could be turned over for development at any time with community board approval. The gardeners have secured a [GreenThumb](http://www.greenthumbnyc.org/about.html) [license to garden temporarily](http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2014/09/28/development_battles.php). They are going before various city agencies and the community board to have the garden turned over to the Parks Department so that they can continue maintaining the green space and hosting community events without fear that the land will be developed. When Ilyse gave us a tour of the garden, she was fresh off a meeting with members of the community board the evening before. They made another small victory against loosing their garden to development.

The lot that they trespass through in the middle of the two public access lands was purchased by [William Gottlieb](http://nypost.com/2012/01/08/monopoly-man/) in 1984 for about $5k.

Here are some videos of the gardeners getting signatures.

This video shows what the data gathering process is like to identify public access lots accurately here and in the UK.
