Victor Schklovsky: defamiliarization 

"The language of poetry is designed to prolong the act of perception by contrast to the smoothness of prose which is designed to facilitate comprehension"

Poetic speech is formed (cannot be predicted)

Prose speech is ordinary economical easy proper

art: defamiliarizing the familiar

efficiency vs meaning (intuition) emotional

Some things can be direct and pure and still be defamiliarized
