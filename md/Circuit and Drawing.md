*   Talking in small groups and as a whole about these questions.

        *   What is a computer?
    *   Draw a diagram of how a computer works.

                *   When you are making software
        *   What happens in your computer when you are looking at facebook?

*   This is how I would have drawn a computer 4 years ago.

*   This is how I would draw a computer now.

**[Von Neuman Architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture)**

*   The unit for storing data and the units for storing instructions can be in the same place.

*   What we're commonalities between the groups in how you drew how your computer works.

        *   CPU and Memory are talking to each other quite often.
    *   When you hit the key what is happening to the input to translate into pixels, binary.
    *   It is from us the things we need from it.
    *   Power oriented - map (battery)
    *   Drawn Boxes

*   CPU and Memory are so entwined in how software works.
*   What happens when you create an html file.

        *   The life cycle of his html file.

*   George Perec's Book

        *   A story of apt buildings according to different rooms.
    *   A story about a computer told from the point of view of different 
    *   When I ask an electric computer engineer what a computer is he will talk about electrons.

**Instruction-less Computing**

*   Load the memory but it doesn't say execute.

*   Its weird to be typing into a void.

*   Trying to see if the guy could be ALU and the other hand is the bus.
*   Register

        *   Short term memory
    *   Copy data for a bit of time
    *   Shift registers and flip flops
    *   Latch that you lock the door the enables the computers to remember.

*   Act of Cooking is control unit + ALU

        *   Remembering ordred => memory
    *   Getting food  => output

*   Memory
*   RAM, CPU

        *   Has its own cash
    *   Think of these as interchangeable.
    *   The only reason we have so many versions of memory is price tradeoff

                *   If it was cheap to make chance which is in your CPU we wouldn't have hard-drives.

        *   From a software point of view you are accessing these abstracted.
    *   Someone made the decisions where the data gets saved.

*   [Large Computer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Early_computers)
*   When computers where as big as size of rooms where did things get stored.

*   Clock

        *   [](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_clock)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_clock
    *   What makes all this works is a clock.
    *   A clock is a crystal.

                *   Oscillates at some frequency, when it hits this crystal and the light goes through.
        *   Every time a signal hits one of these to it is how the control unit decides to do something.
*

        *   Now clocks are silicon.

*   Calculator and Computer

        *   This ability to describe information its what makes it different form mechanical computers.
    *   Human supplements the mechanical computer.

                *   Someone who is good at simple math.
        *   Who is computer is it a she.

*   Why is analog computer more poetic or interesting than silicon.
*   There is no really wrong answer, glitches are more celebrated here.
*   Is object oriented programming similar to modular computer.
*   You give up control.
*   Free form experiment.
*   Layers of discovery.
*   Nostalgia for Materiality.
*   Appeal in restricting choices.
*   Digital input and output could be as effective.
*   direct manipulation of data (signal), low level of abstraction 
*   Why do people now have a retro active view.
*   Grew-up on cds, there is streaming, but we go back to vinyls.
*   Photoshop => go back to photography
*   Very few languages 
*   the uncertainty tools of software are controlled by us.

*   At the end of this week you should be able to make something like this.

        *   1 bit computer using 2 Nand gate chips.
    *   Will take about 4 or 5 hours to make.

*   Jonathan Dahan Workshops

        *   Depending on how experience the group is we can decide on the project.

*   [Gabriella Levine](http://gabriellalevine.com/) will be here tomorrow.

        *   She builds aquatic robots
