# Speculative Computing

Tega (20min)

*   Introduce computational metaphor
*   history of cross over between ecology and cybernetics
*   systems in the ecological and cybernetic sense
*   cross over between these two complex systems (viruses, weeds, worms etc
*   common metaphors of command line and computing eg. spam, verbs of command line, gui, desktop etc. 
*   spam

Taeyoon (20min)

*   Military history of computation
*   ?

**Exercise (30min)**

One of the following:

*   design an alternative gui for an operating system based on a different set of extended visual metaphors of your choosing. 
*   design an different command line operating system that adopts a different vocabulary of metaphors based on a system other than that of war/military. 

*   We encourage you to conceive an alternative history that has led to the development of this alternative computer system. If war was not the driving force, what was instead? Does this position computation differently as to its role in our lives, our relationships with computers, our expectatons of them etc? 

*   **Shall we set specific outcomes for this?**
