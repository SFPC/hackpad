**To do and learn:**

*   get comfortable with these, specifically movement & animation:

        *   concepts

                *   sin, cos
        *   push pop matrix

        *   environments

                *   processing
        *   openframeworks
        *   aftereffects
        *   d3

*   sound design
*   integrate sound with animation sketches
*   make sketches that are interactive (a person can interact and play in addition to / instead of passively experiencing sketches)
*   small weekly exercises
*   blog regularly on sketches or thoughts about readings

**Timeline**

*   **Week of Nov 3**

**Concepts to explore while learning the above ^ :**

*   ways of communication
*   one person's reality vs another person's reality
*   how miscommunication, mistranslation, glitches happen, and results in unexpected outcomes in a person's experience.
*   use  cos / sin as stand-ins for person 1 and person 2 to explore  communication, translation & conflict *resolution* (but a positive,  learning from it phrase) between the two.
*   use noise or drawing with time as a metaphor for person 1's process of learning person 2's way of communication, listening and adding on to a conversation to come to a shared understanding

**Work that inspires me in this moment; work that's addresses "translation":**
