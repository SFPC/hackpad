# Binary Numbers

Basis of computation.

*   What do they mean what do they feel like.
*   In terms of code who wants to learn what.
*   Think about this topic from the standpoint of pedagogy.
*   When I say Binary numbers what do you think of.

        *   0 1 0 1
    *   Machine language.
    *   A light switch.
    *   Input/Output
    *   True and False

*   They are the building blocks.
*   There are only 10 different kinds of people in the world.
*   Audacity import Raw Data.

        *   Doesn't know anything about the file.
    *   Every pixel translated into every decibel in audio.
    *   If we add noise to the image and save it again as raw

*   Thinking about Binary numbers as an information display.
*   We are used to counting in base ten.
*   Alot of things that make up code is made up of binary numbers.
*   Computers are a machine that push electricity at a constant rate.

        *   It uses electricity to build things that create computation.
    *   256 values with 8 zeros and ones.

*   Binary numbers as permutations.

*   A knob, you want to figure out how much you have rotated the knob.
*   A lot of them work optically.
