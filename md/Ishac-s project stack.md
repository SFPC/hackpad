**About dual-sense communication and human-computer language.**

![](https://hackpad-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/hackpad.com_Rt6HUtbBzw5_p.77457_1383420427723_boxes.jpeg) 

Explore communication between two computers that use only a screen and a camera to recognize each other and establish a conversion, using characteristic human computer visual language such as cursors and progress bars.

**Visuals of computation**

A pocket book with visual representations of concepts mentioned during sfpc lectures.

**About metadata and film photography**

![](https://hackpad-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/hackpad.com_Rt6HUtbBzw5_p.77457_1383420460710_camera.jpeg) 

Use a hacked film camera to capture _everything_ regarding a specific moment, _but_ the picture itself. Construct memories by looking at the pictures containing only data.

**About computers that compute to _be_**

![](https://hackpad-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/hackpad.com_Rt6HUtbBzw5_p.77457_1383420474450_ceramics.jpeg) 

It's a counter inside a ceramic object. When you pour ceramics over the computer to create the object, it becomes alive and starts counting as it disappears inside the object. The computer counts for itself, it's its life clock - it doesn't communicate it's status, or tells when it dies. Its appearance is always inert.

**Sampling time with X**

![](https://hackpad-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/hackpad.com_Rt6HUtbBzw5_p.77457_1383420480319_time.jpeg) 

We use time to sample space, sound, light, etc. What does it mean to sample time with any of those?

___

**About perception of time and space**

![](https://hackpad-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/hackpad.com_Rt6HUtbBzw5_p.77457_1383420493759_clock.jpeg) 

A clock and a ruler that represent a personal perception of time. Intervals of time (sec) and space (cm) based on personal perception are precisely measured and engraved in a tool that serves to measure time and space using the new units.

The wobbly shape references Dali's soft watches.

**The last words of electronics components**

![](https://hackpad-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/hackpad.com_Rt6HUtbBzw5_p.77457_1383420502038_die.jpeg) 

A high voltage drop is applied to different electronic components to _kill_ them, while a signal (R?) is being monitored. Sync with photo camera at high speed.

___

**About lines and relationships**

![](https://hackpad-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/hackpad.com_Rt6HUtbBzw5_p.77457_1383420539910_lines.jpeg) 

A set of conditions are applied to two particles (pos, vel, attraction, repulsion, excitement, â€¦) generating ~1000 postcards. Stories are created by selecting different snapshots as moments of these lines' relationship, and placing them in a wall.

___

**About a message containing the medium conditions**

![](https://hackpad-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/hackpad.com_Rt6HUtbBzw5_p.77457_1383420545099_redundancy.jpeg) 

Explore how a pattern and a piece of software can encode environmental conditions.

A pattern containing redundant sub-patterns is sent together with a piece of software. The software runs computer vision to analyze the pattern, and will only display _true_ when the environmental conditions (light sources, angle, reflections) are exactly the same as the ones the sender used in the moment of encrypting the conditions into the software.

Each sub pattern is a condition in series (x && y && z) with the others to confirm that the pattern is recognized. Only if all sub patterns are recognized, the master pattern is _true_. This will only happen when the receiver has recreated the exact same conditions that the sender used to capture the pattern.

___

**About negative afterimages over time**

![](https://hackpad-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/hackpad.com_Rt6HUtbBzw5_p.77457_1383420556893_retina.jpeg) 

Visual series of very contrasted shapes to create negative afterimage effect in different shades.

I'm keen to help out on the pocket book of creative comp concepts if you'd like a collaborator.

Sure, I have only a few done. I put together (it's in my sketchbook at school, feel free to check it out) but we can go through the hackpads and prioritize, and see how far we can go.

I also really like your question of what it means to sample through time. I'd love to discuss this more?

Maybe this relates in some way to [relativity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity)? Prior to Einstein, no one could explain why when you accelerate towards a body, time speeds up and when you move away from it, time appears to slow down. This was because it was (incorrectly) assumed that time was a constant. Einstein was able to reconsider this assumption and suggest that actually time dilates - ie. it is not constant and rather the space/time relationship is the constant. So I'm not quite sure where this tangent is going...but I guess that sampling assumes a constant flow of time? 

With Dahan we're discussing the fact that we use time to sample everything - space, sound, even activities. It helps analyse patterns, average, etc. considering, of course, that the time gradients are constant. As you say, in certain situations, the samples won't be constant as we understand them. Is then when it makes sense to sample time with something else -constant- that allows to see the time variations. We didn't get anywhere specific yet, but our open question was what would it mean, or how would we represent time as the variable we want to sample, selecting different secondary variables to slice it. With some pair of variables is easy to just switch the axis and it makes sense, with time is super abstract. Maybe the way to approach it is maths, and probably there are examples. Let's chat!

Also, sampling requires taking a guess at a frequency (or scale). It only reveals phenomena around happening slower than the sampling rate. Things happening at much faster frequencies remain invisible (things above the [Nyquist frequency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_frequency)) - of course this is called aliasing. What does this mean for your question? I don't know :) But that's an interesting aspect too!

i love all of these ideas, i said already few weeks ago, id be happy to help out/ collaborate on the book and electronic projects. Im bringing some more stuff in tomorrow, to show you and others some options with counting and latching memory. note (Wed: synth for Andy) (Tue or Thur: sound for Le)
