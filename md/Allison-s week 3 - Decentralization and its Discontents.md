**Tyranny of Structurelessness - Jo Freeman**

Jo Freeman's background:

The article:

*   can pick up on her personal feeling throughout the piece. access to tools like printing press from husbands...
*   structurelessness organizations

        *   lack of structure creates informal structures. a formal structure allows people to question decision making and participate whereas informal structures do not
    *   lack of structure will allow 'elite' smaller groups to become the defacto leaders
    *   structurelessnes might not really exist, since structures appear automaticly in groups

*   Hidden power - it is to an 'elite's' benefit to not be named

        *   Not being able to point on the people in control makes it hard to influence the power, and if you struggle against it, not knowing where it is makes it hard to fight against it.
    *   this is an early work (macromedia) that pulls in the names of people who sit on multiple boardsÂ¨
    *   when you make structure explicit then the people who are in 'power' have a responsibility to those who are not in power

*   How have we experienced this personally?

        *   occupy
    *   robert's rules of order

                *   govt protocol
