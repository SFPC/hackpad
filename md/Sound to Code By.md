# Sound to Code By

There was a really interesting scene of music/code in Australian in the 1970s. This guy, [Warren Burt](http://www.warrenburt.com/), is still going strong.

There's been some great background music on at Orbital this past week. Toss in here links to the stuff we've been listening to or any other suggestions you have of sound to code by.
