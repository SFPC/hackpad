**<u>Google Street Sound</u>**

**Walk around in NYC with sound (by controling accelerator)**

<u>idea </u>

I think that the sound in NYC is characteristic to me. I mean there are sounds of taxi, people talking, subway.....

I always imagine that I can walk around with characteristic sound in NY

1 record sound in NYC with location data

2 put sound data to oF project

3 explore NYC by controling the device which sends location

4 you can hear any sounds depending on your location.

<u>things to use for this project</u>

it's kind of similar to previous project.

*   openframeworks
*   arduino?

<u>necessary knowledge to get done this work and questions</u>

*   how to record sounds including location data

<u>input</u>

*   iphone(accelerometer)
*   arduino(accelerometer)

<u>output</u>

this is version 1. it really hard to collect so many sounds in 3 days. i think i should forcus on more specific area, like around sfpc or subway(cirtain stations)

<core stuff i want to do>

*   change volume by accelemeter
*    generate sound file of hitory your walk
*   comunicate with ipad app and osx app for visualize your location and volume of sounds

<.farther>

*   use opengl
*   indicate your location on actual map with light (pen) by arduino
