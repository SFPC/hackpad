*   Used yelp to write about art but not be in the systems.

        *   People responded to it because they already knew me as an art critic.
    *   Taste as an arbitrary thing, where everyones experience is different.
    *   Usually I write comments about the show, but sometimes I write about the architecture of the gallery.
    *   Yelp is about individual subjectivity.

*   Galleries as a storefront and a business.

        *   What they are providing as a service is an experience.

*   Have to be part of a gallery in order to be part of a market.
*   You shouldn't care what an art critic thinks, you should just do what you want.
*   Yelp Reviews

        *   Done from a first person, ver subjective.
    *   There is no editorial filter.
    *   People telling stories  about their experience there.

*   Interested in how discourse is produced for the public sphere.
*   Interesting Yelp Reviews

        *   McDonalds, and Dunkin' Donuts.
    *   Similar to museums where the experience also get standardize.

*   Critique of Judgement (Book)
*   Art writing

        *   Has become very academic and impersonal.

*   Inside the White Cube (Book)

        *   Wasn't always a white cube.
    *   Isolates art from the rest of life.
    *   The viewer becomes an organ of pure cognition.

*   Museum Bodies (Book)
*   FIrst public Museum was the Louvre

        *   Hosted Salons.
    *   Basically art fairs.
    *   10 days later after the revolution ended the louvre became a public museum.

*   We think its so normal to walk into a gallery and look at art.

        *   Not touching anything and become quite were explicit instructions given in museums.
    *   19th century idea of how people should be.

*   Didero

        *   wrote the first encyclopedia.
    *   wrote about paintings himself, in a conversational and informal way.
    *   Academy of Fine Arts in Paris

                *   had people write about the arts that were exhibited.
        *   we're influential on the market.

*   Are museums a didactic tool for delivering history or some kind of sensory experience?
*   Has Yelped contacted you.
*   Some people are interested in professionalism and art careers.
*   Many people are dependent on yelp reviews.
*   Review Mafia.
*   You don't really have say over what galleries do.
*   Cultural production of art.
*   Using the yelp star as kind of metric.

        *   Star rating is kind of ridiculous as quantifying an experience.
    *   Assigning numbers to emotion.
    *   Comments are funny, useful, or cool.

*   What is the main drive for people to write reviews.

        *   Some people like to talk about themselves and share their experiences.
    *   Compared to facebook your putting alot of effort for relatively small amount of feedback.
    *   Not as social as facebook.

*   Yelp has a network of elite user.

        *   Tend to give more 4 and 5 stars reviews.

*   Yelp review workshop.

        *   Practicing writing about museums.

*   Rate my professor.
*   Sort of everything failed
