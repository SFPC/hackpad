# **Welcome to hackpad - the collaborative notepad**

Hi all! This is a <u>public</u>, collaborative wiki that I'd like to try out for sharing things like resources, lesson plans, and works in progress. Let me know if you have questions: casey@sfpc.io

*   Create pads (by clicking the "**+**" button above) and **invite people** to them.  Once they arrive, you can **edit in real-time**.  Changes made when the other people aren't around are **emailed to everyone.**

*   _type here to try it out_

*   You can organize pads into **collections **on the right hand side menu, or you can put **#hashtags** directly into your notes that associate notes with eachother

*   You can create **todo items** like these by clicking on the checkbox button above.

*   To access your pads on the go, just open this website on your **iPhone** or **Android.**

Have fun!
