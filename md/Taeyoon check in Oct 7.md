**OF workshop in Saturday **

Hi Taeyoon and Zach,

Hope SPFC is going well !

I am going to host a new OF workshop on Saturday Oct 18th. In this workshop, participants will learn how to use ofxKinectV2-OSC. This addon gives you realtime access to KinectV2 skeletal data in openFrameworks - Mac or Windows. It will be taught by [Andrew McWilliams](http://www.jahya.net/). 

I don't know if this workshop is interesting for SFPC students. If it was interesting, I could bring the workshop to SFPC.

Best,

Paul
