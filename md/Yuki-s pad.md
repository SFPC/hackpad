# Yuki's pad

Yuki's idea pad. It's all open, so welcome to collaborate if you're interested in or make a branch for your projects or submit issues if you know something similar or some nice references.

** random ideas for projects**

*   Life program game

-        - There is a code to execute.

        - To execute each function, I need to go somewhere and checkin with a mobile.

        - Things I did in the location will be arguments.

                - eg) Take a photo -> `void centralPark(ofImage myPhoto){ doSomething(myPhoto);}`

        - The code returns something when I execute all functions.

        - play with a concept of giving arguments and get return by real life.

**mini projects from class**

*   binary
*   animation
*   language
*   minicomputers
*   project having social contextual insight

**new language to learn hello world**

*   python

**NYC Project**

Now, I'm in the most exciting and busiest city in the world.

I should do something using NYC. 

Principles

        - Go outside and make a public interactions.

        - Do something I cannot do from Tokyo.

Tech assets

        - open data NYC ([](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/))https://nycopendata.socrata.com/)

        - geolocations 

        - etc

City assets

        - people from different origins

        - grid geography

        - Times square

        - central park

        - bridges

        - yellow cabs

        - Trees ( [](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Street-Tree-Census-Manhattan-/e6n3-m3vc)https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Street-Tree-Census-Manhattan-/e6n3-m3vc ) 

        - etc

**Teaching**
<undefined><li>Maps</li></undefined>

I learnt teaching is the best way of learning.

Maps API is one of my most favourite API, so it's also good chance for me to explore new projects. Maybe Google is easy to start. Investigating OpenStreet beside.

*   I will make a hackpad at first soon.

Things to cover: 

- Basics

- Maps for non use for maps

- Connect with different platforms

        - Google Maps x openFramworks

        - Google Maps x arduino

My new project with maps

- Finger walk interface (OF multitouch x streetview)

        - now progress 60%

*     - run JS in OF was good learn and nice to share, make a hackpad
