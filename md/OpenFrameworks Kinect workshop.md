# OpenFrameworks Kinect workshop

Saturday, October 18, 2-4PM

_In this workshop we will learn how to use ofxKinectV2-OSC. This addon gives you realtime access to KinectV2 skeletal data in openFrameworks - Mac or Windows. _

_One of the barriers to using KinectV2 is that it must run on Windows. Many creative coders use openFrameworks on Mac & XCode. I'll show you how to run a simple utility in Windows which broadcasts the KinectV2 data, and use the ofxKinectV2-OSC addon to render the skeleton on your Mac._

_All you need to bring for the workshop is a laptop running a recent version of openFrameworks. However, if you have a KinectV2 sensor and/or a Windows laptop capable of running KinectV2, please bring those along to try out running the broadcast utility yourself._
