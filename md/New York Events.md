**<u>Jenny Holzer: Dust Paintings</u>**

*   What: Jenny Holzer has used government documents as a source for her work since 2004. Language has been Holzer’s primary medium since the late 1970s. Placed on electronic signs or stone benches, Holzer’s text investigates how ideas are transformed from argument or opinion into fact. While her work has a conceptual base, she involves her viewer through what’s intensely physical. Turning to government documents in 2004, months after the invasion of Iraq by the United States and the United Kingdom, Holzer tried to reconstruct the path to war from the language of its architects and executors. The documents painted most recently trace the political fallout and human wreckage in the global war on terror. Holzer’s new works, hand-rendered, return flesh to events.

**<u>Klaus Lutz</u>**

*   What: As the first look by a US institution at this under-recognized, Swiss-born artist and filmmaker’s oeuvre, this show will feature a selection of **Klaus Lutz**’s 16mm film loops, as well as some of his meticulous work on paper and artist books. Shot almost entirely in the artist’s tiny East Village apartment with Lutz performing as his protagonist, the films— using animation, multiple exposures, and often projected onto large, white balloons, creating convex, circular images— depict quasi-mythological tales that, while reminiscent of Georges Méliès and the 1920s avant-garde, ultimately look to develop new visual sign systems for the future.
*   Date(s): **October 30–December 20**
*   Time: Tuesday - Friday, 12-6 PM, Saturday, 11 AM - 6 PM, Free Admission

*   _Where_: Ellis Island
*   _Are you going (add your name)_? 
*   _More info_: [](http://www.saveellisisland.org/artist-jrs-ellis-island-southside-project/)http://www.saveellisisland.org/artist-jrs-ellis-island-southside-project/
*   From the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/arts/design/jr-brings-ellis-islands-abandoned-hospital-to-life.html?_r=0): "In the century-old photo, seven children gaze straight at the camera, looking hopeful or somber, or perhaps simply stunned at their surroundings. They have just landed on Ellis Island.
*   Their heads were wrapped in white cloth; they suffered from favus, a scalp disease. Deemed unfit for entry into the United States, they were sent to the island’s enormous hospital, where they were studied, treated and photographed. Most likely, they were eventually released, healthy, to their new homeland.
*   Their experience might have been forgotten, the photo buried with countless others in an archive. Instead, this black-and-white portrait has been revived, blown up to life-size and pasted across a broken window in the former Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital in New York harbor. Light streams through the children’s translucent faces, foliage visible beyond the crumbling building, which has been abandoned and off limits since 1954.
*   The image is part of <u>[a new installation,](http://www.saveellisisland.org/artist-jrs-ellis-island-southside-project/)</u> “Unframed — Ellis Island,” by the French artist JR, which brings this landmark building, its patients and staff members, to grainy but wrenching life. It is the first time in 60 years that the Ellis Island hospital has been open to the public. <u>[Tickets go on sale](http://www.statuecruises.com/)</u>Thursday for guided tours that begin on Oct. 1."

**<u>Making Music Modern: Design for Eye and EarEvent Template</u>**

*   What: Music and design—art forms that share aesthetics of rhythm, tonality, harmony, interaction, and improvisation—have long had a close affinity, perhaps never more so than during the 20th century. Radical design and technological innovations, from the LP to the iPod and from the transistor radio to the Stratocaster, have profoundly altered our sense of how music can be performed, heard, distributed, and visualized.

**<u>Cut to Swipe</u>**

*   What: _Cut to Swipe_, comprised primarily of recent acquisitions by the Department of Media and Performance Art, features works that appropriate and manipulate images and sound drawn from electronic media like television, cinema, the recording industry, and the Internet. _Cut to Swipe_ traces key works, produced since the early 1980s, which have pioneered innovative ways of rearticulating the moving image and appropriated cultural forms within the gallery. If the cut signifies collage and montage, foundational artistic strategies of the 20th century, the swipe suggests a 21st-century condition in which images have moved off the screen, dispersed at the flick of a finger into almost every corner of daily life.
