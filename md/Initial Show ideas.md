# Initial Show ideas

**Showing connections of people's work**

  I volunteer to draw a chalk map of concepts, artifacts, learning processes, images, that connect pieces in the space. Sort of like a mindmap, maybe we start with a collaborative map (like this hackpad).

this kind of big map, cartography of ideas and tools, opinions and etc might be really interesting .eyebeam has a big black wall now (south east wall) maybe we can use that as a board.
