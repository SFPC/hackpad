TASTED is a project that investigates the way we taste food and its flavor.   Nowadays it is possible to identify a product’s flavor profile through gas chromatography.  Starting from a data set of 1000+ ingredients and their flavor compound profiles, Tasted combines ingredients in pairs resulting in over a million combinations.

Insecurity Camera by Andy Clymer 

The Insecurity Camera is a security camera who looks the other way. On a day to day basis we can’t avoid the gaze of security cameras and closed-circuit television monitoring us, but the Insecurity Camera doesn’t want to watch what we’re doing. It’s just as uncomfortable with you looking at it, as you probably are of it looking at you.

Every Text is a visualization of text message activity from select SFPC students. Each image contains every text sent in the lifetime of the student’s phone, represented as a dot in the grid. Dots are colored and initialed according to the person on the other end of the line, and outlined or filled dots indicate messages sent or received.

This sculpture is an experiment in bringing mathematically generated forms into the physical world. I began by exploring parametric equations and lissajous figures. This resulted in a program that drew an interesting calligraphy-esque form, that looks more like it was produced by a human than a computer.

It is almost like the viewers are making their own spoken language.

The first part of the project was data collection. I worked on an app to collect the sounds. I created a quick instruction pages and ask people make a sound that the symbol might portray. It was challenging to engage the viewer to interact with my app, but I added a few practice run and it seemed to work better.

The second part of the project was the visualization. I used the audios and videos of sound people made as a material to create my interactive art piece. The first was the video of SFPC students reading the quote from the introduction to the declaration of Hangeul called “Hun-min-jung-eum” using their own sound. The second was the app that averaged the sound for the single symbol. The viewer can choose the symbol that they want to listen to and when they press the symbol 21 different sounds and mouth played simultaneously.

"The way it worked was he gave a hug, then I gave a hug and then people voted on which they preferred.

"So that was the question I asked at Eyebeam, Who do_ you_ love? I asked people to text a number with the name of the person they love. Moments later, human voices screamed back the name of the person, for example:

Talking investigates the mechanics of experience, expression, and communication. Using computer-vision techniques to design a single-sense computing device, we develop a framework for thinking about the processes involved in perception and interaction.

"Piet is an interesting programming language - instead of using text as source code, it uses pixels, or rather the color of pixels.
