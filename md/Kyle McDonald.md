*   Structures on the walls are based on the reflection coming from the Mirrorballs that are being projected onto.
*   Computer Vision with Structure Light
*   Take a 3d models and line it up.
*   Camamuk
*   Line up vertices with an image.
*   Easy to Prototype with GLSL.
*   Normally when doing processing, your code is being compiled or interpreted, but width Glsl, its compiled by the graphic card.
*   can write new code.
*   artist who generatively make art on the graphics card.
