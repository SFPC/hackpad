# Making LED balloons

So a friend of mine wants to have some balloons illuminate, for a party that lasts at least 6 hours. The brighter the better.

Well its a good thing that 2032 CRC batteries will last an LED for over a day easily, especially if you use a [resistor to limit the initial current](http://www.evilmadscientist.com/2009/some-thoughts-on-throwies/) !

**LED floaties**

*   balloons 
*   [10mm diffused led](http://www.adafruit.com/products/846)  (2x25 = $25)
*   [2032 battery](http://www.adafruit.com/products/654) (50 = $75)
*   220 ohm resistor (2x25 = $5)

50 LED floaties will be anywhere from $50-$100
