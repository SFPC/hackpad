# SFPC "Yearbook"

**Goals: **

*   To provide a cohesive document (paper/digital) of the students work and what they got out of the program (tools, ideas). 
*   Will be distributed and available at the final event for participants - help provide 'glue' between the displayed works and tie it back to the school and program.
*   Can be used for prospective students to provide context on what previous participants experienced.
*   Will be an awesome thing for us to have as well ;-)

**Questions:**

*   Why did you come to SFPC and what did you hope to accomplish/learn
*   What are some of the tools/languages you've learned that you are excited about
*   What concepts or topics did you learn about here that you want to learn more about
*   What is the one thing or day that will really stick with you
*   What is poetic computation?
*   what are some ideas I started and didn't finish here
*   what I want to work in over the next 3-6 months 

Small vistories, sewing seeds, asking questions and from the fundamental.
