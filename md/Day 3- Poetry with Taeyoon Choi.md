Lee mentioned [Methods of Loci / Memory Palaces / Mnemonic techniques](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci)

We're going to use a method to generate our own constrained writing using the following: 

<u>CONSTRAINED WRITING EXERCISE</u>

1.  NEGATION : 140 char
2.  TRANSFORMATION
3.  FEEDBACK

Assignment [proposition]:

Create a constraint – algorithmic, computational or both – using the following poem:

**   **At Dawn**
**   In my dream the head of a child was in the center.
**   If the clouds gather on your roof and the rain spares you, will you keep the secret of this double miracle?
**   But no voice calls you. If you get up, barefoot, you'll get sick. Where would you go, anyway, across these ravines of light.
**   The quilts keep the silence. Legs folded under, he walks on his wings and goes out. He was an angel and the whiter morning that was rising.
*
