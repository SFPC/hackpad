*   Music video made by controlling 250 cameras & strobes.
*   Used the photographs.
*   250 cameras, arduino, openframeworks.

        *   Found rental cameras, 250 was the max
    *   Created an adobe air system to simulate the camera wall.
    *   We needed a way to figure it out in our minds.

*   Made a website augments the experience.
*   Even if its a low budget and a real challenge if the idea is cool you can find the people that will believe in the idea.
*   Prepared 50 extra cameras.

        *   Not the same strobe and not the same camera.
    *   Theres a beauty in this sort of imperfection in the things that you do for real.

*   <u>We call ourselves a creative lab</u>

*   If you call your self and agency you will only get commercial work.

*   The structure and the way they work limits what they can produce.
*   Made for efficiency but not innovative out.
*   The trick here is to understand the right brand manager that knowns what you are talking about.

*   Love to experiment in the ways that we work as well.

*   Experiment with teamwork, the method and the process.
*   Creative Director & Tech Director team.

        *   What is the best combination of the two.
    *   Much more efficient.

*   Be creative in a ways to make things.
*   Instead of saying we do advertising and communicaiton.

        *   We try to create an entertainment of product with you.
    *   So much better when you tackle the real core problem.

                *   Bottom up approach.

*   We want to be creative in execution and process.

        *   If you make things in a different way theres is a better chance to get something interesting.

*   It can t just be the technology there has to be something more than that.
*   Thinking about the physical engagement not just the digital experiences.
*   Sometimes the basic idea of the project is not bad but the platform that it is for is bad.

*   Prototype

*   Prototype of a business model.

*   If people want to do it, they can, but we can also work on it and have experience with it.

*   Ideal solution would be to find a VC and a CEO for the project and back away after.

*   Clients can;t really buy and idea that the haven't seen an idea before.

*   Increasing the risk of investment upfront by yourself.

*   We want to prove ourselves and create projects that we actually want to talk about.

*   We always want to present ideas that we know are feasible.

*   The is a limit to our imagination, in terms of polishing our story board.

*   How do you make this jump into doing something in a way your not comfortable with. #question

        *   Challenge addicts.
    *   Were you set your own goals.
    *   Create an element of an idea that can be talked about.

                *   Maybe its in the story.
        *   The filmmaking.

        *   Has to add up, the story and the technology.

                *   Awesome + Awesome

        *   If it makes sense to enhance the message then we take the extra step to go in a different way.
