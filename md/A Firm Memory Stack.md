**8-bit binary typing tutor**

_'teaching binary'  in-class assignment from Zach_

_collaborated/in conjunction with Hiro_

inspired from patatap.com

**a new language proposition**

**_'_**_from_

what kind of sorcery is happening in this if statement?

two operators are helpful to understand here: >> is a bit shift operator.   You can take a number (in binary) like

*   10010 >> 1 = 1001 
*   10010 << 1 = 100100

it's kind of like a divide or multiply by two (in a primitive sense without rounding, floating point numbers, etc....   1011 (11) >> 1 = 101 (5), for example)

The second operator is &, which is an and operator.  It returns true if both bits are true. 

[](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Projects/CAL/digital-logic/gatesfunc/index.html#andgate)http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Projects/CAL/digital-logic/gatesfunc/index.html#andgate

*   0 & 0 = 0
*   1 & 0 = 0
*   0 & 1 = 0
*   1 & 1 = 1

So this code is, in a for loop, shifting the number down.  The 7-i is because we are drawing from right to left, so we want to look from the top most bit when i = 0.    We are shifting down to different directions, ie, 

*   10010111 is being checked as
*   10010111  >> 7 = 1
*   10010111  >> 6 = 10
*   10010111  >> 5 = 100
*   10010111  >> 4 = 1001
*   10010111  >> 3 = 10010
*   10010111  >> 2 = 100101
*   10010111  >> 1 = 1001011
*   10010111  >> 0= 10010111

then, we see if the last bit = 1, by & with 1 (0x01 is a way of writing 1 in hex)

*   1 & 0x01 = 1
*   10 & 0x01 = 0
*   100 & 0x01 = 0
*   1001 & 0x01 = 1
*   ... etc

hope this helps!

indeed! thank you!

also this link also super helpful

## Assignments (propositions) // buffer // pre-project stack
<ul><li>Jonathan's Combining two pieces of data</li>
<li>Zach's Tuesday assignment

*   **a)** create tools / systems / scenarios for writing and reading code not on the screen.  

*   are there better systems you can develop for working with code?   For identifying questions and understanding?

*   **b)** tell a story using variable names.  you code should compile, but also be interesting and evocative to read as text. focus on code as text, can you play with this?  

*   Look at poems by apollinaire.   outrageous examples can be found in the obfuscated code contest ([](http://www.ioccc.org/2000/bmeyer.c))[http://www.ioccc.org/2000/bmeyer.c](http://www.ioccc.org/2000/bmeyer.c)) and also in ishac's code poems:
*   [](http://www.creativeapplications.net/processing/code-poems-by-ishac-bertran-poetry-with-code/)[http://www.creativeapplications.net/processing/code-poems-by-ishac-bertran-poetry-with-code/](http://www.creativeapplications.net/processing/code-poems-by-ishac-bertran-poetry-with-code/) 
*   (there should be a copy at school)

*   **c)** feel comfortable with scope and variables and arrays.   make some sketches.  
*   **d)** read some code that's out of your comfort level, generate a bunch of question about it. 
*   **e)** play with memory in weird ways - make programs that crash.
</li>
<li>>>> memories and name project</li>
<li>explore more languages</li>
<li>make one thing out of what Hiro taught me,, arduino - node - browser</li>
<li>poem/game out of 'the dawn' poem</li>

*</ul class="code">

*   **At Dawn**

**   In my dream the head of a child was in the center.
**   If the clouds gather on your roof and the rain spares you, will you keep the secret of this double miracle?
**   But no voice calls you. If you get up, barefoot, you'll get sick. Where would you go, anyway, across these ravines of light.
**   The quilts keep the silence. Legs folded under, he walks on his wings and goes out. He was an angel and the whiter morning that was rising.
