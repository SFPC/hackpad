# Post SFPC-- the other drugs after the main drug

several of us spoke about doing a google hangout post sfpc along with a reading.

i propose that we do the reading Tega suggested last-- don't think we ever got around to it.

Hi all, 

For those interested Ive chosen the first couple of chapters of Jaron Lanier's You Are Not a Gadget since he's come up a bunch of times lately. 

Its an easy read so lets try and do the first two chapters of the excerpt attached. (see Tega's email for attachment)

I could set up a doodle so we can pick a time-- but in general-- are there certain days better than others? weekend preferred to weekdays, etc.?

just give me a brief idea and maybe we can schedule one hangout before the holidays if some of you are interested. let me know!

Anytime is fine for me, with at least a few days notice.

Some time in the weekend is better for me, probably afternoon NY time so both west coast and europe can join?

Agreed on the weekend. Before the holidays I feel it's hard, personally I only have one weekend left and many xmas gifts to buy :) but probably next Sunday in the morning (Berlin) could work. Just let me know with some notice.
