# Recess Nov 11th

Today we chased the history of pneumatic tubes around the city.

First up the closed City Hall Station as the end of the 6 line.

After getting kicked off one train, we got on the next one and successfully spotted the abandoned station rush by as we moved through to loop back around to the uptown track.

The City Hall station, opened in 1904, is adjacent to the site of an earlier experiment in subterranean transit, the Beach Pneumatic Transit System. 

**The Beach Pneumatic Transit System **

Beach was the editor to Scientific American, a major publication at the time. He wanted to built the pneumatic transit system after a successful demonstration at the American Institute Fair. He couldn't get the permits, so he applied to do a postal pneumatic system as a bluff so he could start construction.

It opened in 1870 after 58 days of construction. It only traveled 1 block. Accounts on number of visitors varies, but it was clearly super popular. 

_The New York Times_ · February 27, 1870

<u>Opening the Bore to Public Inspection--Success of the Undertaking--Great Crowd of Visitors</u>

"Certainly the most novel, if not the most successful, enterprise that New-York has seen for in many a day is the Pneumatic Tunnel under Broadway. A myth, or a humbug, it has hitherto been called by everybody who has been excluded from its interior; but hereafter the incredulous public can have the opportunity of examining the undertaking and judging of its merits. Yesterday the tunnel was thrown open to the inspection of visitors for the first time, and it must be said that every one of them came away surprised and gratified. Such as expected to find a dismal, cavernous retreat under Broadway, opened their eyes at the elegant reception room, the light, airy tunnel and the general appearance of taste and comfort in all the apartments, and those who entered to pick out some scientific flaw in the project, were silenced by the completeness of the machinery, the solidity of the work, and the safety of the running apparatus."

*   After intense lobbying for his once covert project, Beach finally won approval from the mayor to expand his system. Unfortunately, approval coincided with the economic crash of 1873 and the project stopped cold. The station was rediscovered in 1912 when the new BMT subway line began, adjacent to the fully functioning city hall station. Workers burrowed right into the forgotten tunnel. With the forgotten history of New York's first subway rediscovered, a plaque to commemorate Beach's work was ordered to be placed in the City Hall station, but it was never executed on.

**The City Hall station **

was constructed as a turn around for the IRT line

![](http://images.nycsubway.org/i28000/img_28416.jpg)

It's ridership was much slimmer than the Brookln Bridge station. It was closed in 1945 because of low ridership. ([source](http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/Station:_City_Hall_(IRT_East_Side_Line)))

**18th Street and Worth Street Stations**

The City Hall station isn't the only one you can see from a moving 6 train. We kept watching.

Both these stations closed when adjacent stations were lengthened from 5 car to 10 car platforms in the mid-1900s.

**Pneumatic Mail System**

If moving people by pneumatic tubes never really took off, moving mail did. Parallel to the 4/5/6 train, [tubes were installed](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/07/nyregion/underground-mail-road-modern-plans-for-all-but-forgotten-delivery-system.html) as part of the 27 miles connecting post offices throughout Manhattan. The system was [inaugurated in 1897](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumatic_tube_mail_in_New_York_City) and stopped use 1953.

**Grand Central Whispering Gallery**

Thanks to Casey, we took a quick stop at the [whispering gallery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whispering_gallery) on our way to the next destination.

**New York Public Library**

Unfortunately, due to Veterans Day, the Stephen A. Schwarzman Research Library was closed. And upon further research, it looks like we would not have been able to see the pneumatic tube system even if it were open because the [main reading room is closed for repairs](http://www.nypl.org/readingroomupdate)... My bad.

This is the Rose Reading Room and this is what is below it.

The stacks below were never open to the public. You would fill out a call slip and a clerk would send it downstairs via pneumatic tubes, [at least until a few years ago](http://www.timeout.com/newyork/attractions/secrets-of-classic-nyc-new-york-public-library). 

![](http://media.timeout.com/images/resizeBestFit/100255521/660/370/image.jpg)

The library was opened in 1911 on the former site of the Croton Reservoir.

[Imagine croton reservoir](http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/dgkeysearchdetail.cfm?trg=1&strucID=250983&imageid=465504&total=1&e=w) at the site of the nypl, 1879

This pictures was taken 9 years after Beach's pneumatic subway opened. Gives you an idea of what New York was like back then... 

Instead of seeing the library, we were in the middle of this chaos. (Promise no more mid-town on Recess!)

**Roosevelt Island Pneumatic Trash**

We ventured over the tram to Roosevelt Island.

Casey began the search for the pneumatic trash system, built when the island was redeveloped in 1975, previously known as Welfare Island.

"A network of 20-inch tubes takes garbage from the island’s 16 residential towers, collecting from every floor, to a central collection point where it is compacted and trucked off the island. It is at once a simple and elegant solution to gathering trash, and an aging and complicated beast that needs a lot of upkeep." - [Wired](http://www.wired.com/2010/08/trash-sucking-island/all/)

"The AVAC system is the Automated Vacuum Collection System. It was inaugurated in 1975 when the first development on Roosevelt Island opened and today it serves 12,000 inhabitants of the island. Garbage is deposited in a regular building garbage chute, which is gravity-fed, and piles up behind a valve at the bottom. With your average garbage chute, there is a compactor at the bottom that compacts the trash and puts it into bags that are then carried to the curb. Here, there is no compactor – there’s just a plate and a network of tubes that lead to a facility at the end of the island. Engineers at the facility turn the system on several times a day. It could be automatic, but they often run it manually. The valves open, the garbage drops in and is pulled back to the facility with an air speed of 60 miles per hour (the garbage itself, depending on the density, shoots through at 30-60 miles per hour). A cyclone separator then separates the heavy items from the light, after which a dust collector removes the dust from the air, and the all the garbage and dust drops into a compactor and is condensed into one of 10 containers in the facility that are then picked up by the Department of Sanitation. There are two parallel set-ups, one for the east side of the island and one for the west, which run alternately, and which also provide a redundancy that can act as a back-up if one system has a blockage." - [Urban Omnibus](http://urbanomnibus.net/2010/05/fast-trash/) 

We found the control station on the north end of the island.![](https://hackpad-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/hackpad.com_aNjhbudg1K9_p.150416_1415760635902_14-11-11SFPCRecess039.JPG)

Roosevelt Island also showed us some signs of it's 'welfare' past.

The 1796 Blackwell House

In 1829 the city the erection a penitentiary on the island. The Blackwell House became the residential quarters for various institutional administrators.

The Octagon originally served as the main entrance to the New York City Lunatic Asylum, which opened in 1841.

We ended on the north end of the island at the [Blackwell Island Lighthouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackwell_Island_Light).

So, nowadays, while we only use [pneumatic tubes to move messages](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/29/nyregion/neighborhood-report-lower-manhattan-pneumatic-tubes-are-reincarnated-digital-age.html) [if they are in fiber optic cables](http://vimeo.com/30642376) (the old tubes at 60 Hudson Street now house the internet cables from the ocean), they do seem to be good enough for our garbage.
