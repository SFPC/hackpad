# Teachers Mini-School Signup

**December 4th 6:00-8:00**

---------------------------------------------

Hi, here are a few viewing reading materials towards next class, spanning from straight-on MOOC to educational doodles. 

We're going to have an open discussion about what it means to have these materials available to educators, students, and the casually-curious. How is life different (if at all) with these at hand?

Get Amit up to speed on your session from last week, we'll recap what we've learned so far and set up a plan towards the last group of sessions. We'll also take a look at work from Bret Victor, Vi Heart, and Dan Shifman, and discuss their ideas and teaching methodologies.

Building upon last week's session, this week we'll examine how basic code literacy and art literacy can be introduced early on in the learning process. We'll also expand on your individual threads from last week.

**Notes**:

Discussions around teaching examples for the first class focused on getting someone excited to code. 

*   Showing them that anything is possible and there is a brute-force way to get it done which is a good place to start but by learning to program you can get your ideas on screen faster and with less effort. e.g. 10 lines example, can draw 1 line 10 times or use a while loop to automate.

Next steps: teaching color or movement. (found that movement was more exciting for kids to learn vs color)

Teaching color is a great way to introduce bits (16 bit, 32 bit, 64 bit color palate) ex:

*   for a 32 bit color palate imagine 32 empty slots you are going to fill in with vales that will result in a color. 
*   The color palate is made up of 4 channels, RGBA (red, green, blue & alpha)

        *   why is it green and not yellow? Nathan [explains](https://sfpc.slack.com/archives/general/p1414115821000002) and shares a link [2](http://www.poynton.com/notes/colour_and_gamma/ColorFAQ.html)

*   The 32 buckets are divided among the 4 channels giving each value 8 buckets (or bits) of its own. What would go in these? (in the UI the numbers go up to 256, why?)

        *   can talk about counting in binary here

*   The 32 bit color is actually four 8-bit colors divided among RGBA

        *   _[Lauren Gardner](https://sfpc.hackpad.com/ep/profile/yfJwvXOb4rn) nice to create a visual for this_

*   Now introduce 'stroke' with color in the processing example

What puzzles can you give someone to solve that will help them 'level up' their knowledge on a subject?

*   should be no more then 20 lines of code

<undefined><li>**Lauren's homework (electronics puzzles)**</li></undefined>

1.  **how electricity works**

1.  components: what they are, what they do and what do they look like
2.  tools: what are they for and how to use them
3.  integrated circuits:

In this session we'll be discussing last week's assignment and then deconstructing the first 15 minutes of how I teach total beginners to code. By doing so, we'll tease the fundamental ideas that we feel should persist through the teaching of the craft to those who wish to code as a creative act.
