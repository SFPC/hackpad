We tried a few things: 

*   ping yoursite.com
*   curl yoursite.com

**http response codes:**

*   For example a "404" error is "Not Found â€“  Server can not find requested resource. This response code probably is most famous one due to its frequency to occur in web."

An easy tool for creating APIs for pages where there is none. 

We used the following code to pull a specific image from the Met database using the api from [](http://scrapi.org)http://scrapi.org

*   JSONObject json;
*   PImage img;
*   String image_url="";
**   void setup() {
*     json = loadJSONObject("[](http://scrapi.org/object/81781)http://scrapi.org/object/81781");  
*     img = loadImage(json.getString("image"));
*     size(img.width,img.height);
*   }
**   void draw() {
*     image(img, 0, 0, img.width/4, img.height/4);
*   }

**Assignment:**

Use two different pieces of data that [don't require authentication] and combine them to make a 'data visualization.' 

*   **Potential APIs:**
