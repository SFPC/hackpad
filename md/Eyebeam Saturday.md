# Eyebeam Saturday 

SFPC & Alt Ed conversation/ roundtable 

1:00~2:30 pm 

Alternatives in Art & Tech Education 

Roundtable discussion with students and teachers from School for Poetic Computation  and special guests.  

At a time when tuition in the field of art and technology can cost upwards of 40k/yr, the need for other options are self-evident.  What alternatives currently exist and what could an open source school look like?  

Magnet schools, charter schools, and private institutions have a long history, providing alternative education options for school aged children, yet until recently there have been fewer alternatives for adults outside of formal university education. This has changed in the last few years with the proliferation of online training options and New York has seen the rise of of local meet ups, weekend workshops, hacker schools and artist run schools, that are now providing a variety of options to those interested in continuing face-to-face education. 

These initiatives tackle new areas of interest, emerging technologies and facilitate the meeting of others who share similar interests. The School for Poetic Computation fits into this category. A 10 week hybrid of an artist residency and research group, SFPC is a modern experiment in art and technology education.
