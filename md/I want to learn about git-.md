# I want to learn about git!

Put your name and anything git specific you want to know about:

Paige wants to learn about git...I have an account, but that's it!

Rachel - I also have an account and know some basic commands in terminal but could use a refresher/best practices kind of lesson. I have the mac client as well but haven't used it, would be cool to see a demo or something.

Zan - I want to learn about git, github, and best practices for version control workflow and for hosting.  I have an account, and have been using it recently both for version control and gh-pages as a place to host code for live websites.  But, I rely on copy/paste more than I should, which means that I end up not checking things in as often as I should :(. 

I know very little!! Please include me.  I have an account and the Mac App.

Meghana - Got, and have been using github and Mac app for a year or so - but would like to learn more intricacies if we cover it. No specific questions, though.

Yuki - I know git just a basic level with add, commit, push and pull to sync data in my two laptops. I'd like to know more about useful usages of version controls and collaborations.  

Nathan â€” Yes Please. 

Franc - I've been using Git for a while, but could use some best practices and specific explanations about rebasing, branching, and everything that falls beyond committing, pushing, pulling, merging. Also, anybody knows about creative uses of version control?

*   I use branching quite often, and happy to talk about this and also submodules if there's interest.   I do most through command line.
