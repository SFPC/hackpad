First tries:

*   get kinect and rgbd toolkit
*   kinect up and running in OF OSX

*   kinect and OF on Windows, not yet
*   record RGBD video with OBJ sequence output
*   scan small object
*   scan apartment, 3d print

Skanect: [](http://skanect.occipital.com/)http://skanect.occipital.com/ Free trial, up to 5000 faces or $129/yr 

*   - Get what you pay for, nice UI but not very good otherwise, OBJ export is a joke. I'm sure the pay version is better but cloud-based, no thank you. 

KScan 3d: [](http://www.kscan3d.com/)http://www.kscan3d.com/ $299 

*   - Not bad. Used at Alex's studio 6/3/14, clunky/funky UI but seems to do ok. Some bugs while grouping multiple meshes

PhotoScan - Pretty robust, $179

*   pretty solid photogrammetry
