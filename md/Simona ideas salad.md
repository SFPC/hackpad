**<u>Visa Exchange (Eramus)                                                                                         </u>**

An application (software) issued by U.S. government that promote and connect friends in a network whom want to move to US  to work or study.

The applicants around the world after completing a profile registration will be able to find a good fit for the exchange.

Example: Sarah lives and works as fashion designer in NY, she really would love to move to London and she has found a potential job there. The government doesn't make it easy for Sarah to move to UK, as her employer has to go through a very frustrating and long process to prove that no one in UK can do that job.

But Sarah has a friend, well actually a friend of her friend, her name is Joanna. And Joanna, a media artist, is looking to move to New York to experience the city and work as freelance with few clients she is contact with.

Also for Joanna the way to New York is not easy at all, she will have to find a company that would like to offer a job and sponsor her for a Visa, and once more the employer has to prove that no on in US could do the Joanna's job.

_Visa Exchange_ connects Sarah and Joanna and once it is proved that Sarah and Joanna are a perfect fit (in terms of exchange terms, timeframe, etc.) will issue an identity exchange, allowing Sarah to move and work in London while Joanna in New York.

**<u>SFPC time loop  or SFPC clock                                                                              </u>**

Two digital clocks that repeat time in loop:

Clock 1: recognized daily time spent at SFPC over the 10 weeks, it replays over and over in a loop. (with a daily structure eg. week 1 day 1 hour 1 min 1)

Clock 2: countdown clock with the same time structure (week # day # hour # min #) that counts the time to the next SFPC term 

**<u>Oh Captain! My Captain!                                                                                        </u>**

Inspired by the movie Dead Poets Society, this project is a piece of poem written using code language and dedicated to our Robin Williams of the SFPC 

"O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,

The ship has weatherâ€™d every rack, the prize we sought is won,

The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,

While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;

                         But O heart! heart! heart!

                            O the bleeding drops of red,

                               Where on the deck my Captain lies,

                                  Fallen cold and dead."

Artwork is printed on paper and bounded in a big old looking book, some of the pages are ripped out.
