# Questions to start conversations

Thought it might be fun to have a list of questions that we can use to start conversations with each other.  Please add more!  

*   What teaching moment has especially influenced or inspired you or showed you a different way of thinking/doing (in which you were the student)?
*   What's the best dinner you had in the last year: food, atmosphere, people, etc.
