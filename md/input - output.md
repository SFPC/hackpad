# input / output

Class: Input / Output 

Instructor: Zach Lieberman

This class will be held as a series of weekly workshops around techniques and approaches to working with computation and software. We will investigate systems for input, how do we get information into software, focusing specifically on gestural inputs, different sensors systems and signal processing. For output, we will look at graphical, sonic and other approaches to outputting the results of computation. Emphasis will be placed on toolkits and meta level connections between tools that allow us to explore and play with I/O.

Potential workshops involve: signal processing 101, from 2d to 3d, optical systems for interaction, postscript hacking, audio synthesis, approaches to data collecting and analysis
