I co-organize this with Chloe  Varelidi of the Mozilla Foundation. The Yellow Thread Society is New  York's first regular get-together featuring women in games. For this month we are addressing the topic of online communities in games and tech, their nuances, dynamics and how to manage issues such as online harassment.

**[Women in Art and Technology](http://www.ameliamarzec.com/womenarttechnology)  (via Shobun)**

6-9pm[, A.I.R. Gallery](http://www.airgallery.org), 111 Front Street, #228[,](/ep/search/?q=%23228Brooklyn&via=GqFfJEj7zhy) Brooklyn, NY 11201

Technology is the medium we use to communicate today, but we still  experience a gender gap and a generation gap in terms of women’s  participation in technology as a creative medium. A.I.R. Gallery invites  artists, curators, creative technologists, critics, historians and  researchers with an interest in women, art, and technology to join us on  April 23 for an evening event. We’ll talk about women trailblazers in  new media; enjoy presentations by digital artists; and hold a roundtable  discussion to consider these issues within the larger context of the  history of art. Our interest is in creating a platform for further  conversations and participation at the ﬁrst all female cooperative  gallery in the United States.

**[Software Studies Retrospective](http://www.programseries.com/2013-2014/software-studies-a-retrospective/)  (via Zach)**

_5:00pm | 8th Fl. 239 Greene St _

Perhaps more than any other object, software structures our everyday  engagement with digital media technologies. Software is the interface  through which technology becomes accessible for the vast majority of  users, and it is through software that we produce, consume, and  understand the complex workings of technical systems. Software Studies  is a discipline concerned with the critical study of software objects.  First proposed by Lev Manovich at the end of his foundational book _The Language of New Media_,  the field has evolved to include a number of divergent methods and  practices. This event brings together three key scholars in this  emerging field to reflect on how Software Studies has developed and  changed over the past ten years, and to look forward to the future of  this significant field of practice.

**[New Romantics, Night of Performances @ Eyebeam](http://eyebeam.org/events/the-new-romantics)  (via Alexander)**

Doors open to Public 6:00PM

_The New Romantics _is an exhibition exploring  the ways in which contemporary artists using digital media engage the  body, representations of nature, poetic irony, and expressions of  individuality as originally expressed in 19th Century Romanticism. By  drawing equivalences between then and now, this exhibition identifies a  critical precedent for artists today that are responding to their ever  changing technological environment. Just as the Romantics responded to  the industrial revolution, this group of artists are similarly  responding to the current information revolution.

Curators Claudia Hart, Nicholas O’Brien, and Katie  Torn have put together an exhibition that illustrates the diversity and  complexity of contemporary digital production. In doing so, _The New Romantics_ presents a unique selection of works by artists not based on formal similarities, but on expressive affinities.  By employing a myriad of contemporary techniques - including digital  fabrication, 3D simulation, software-based collage, video game engines,  and peer to peer networking tools - the artists in this exhibition  expose an underlying thread of individual expression that extends beyond  mere tech-fetishism.

**[Media Replication Services](http://canopycanopycanopy.com/contents/media_replication_services)**

6:30pm, Whitney Museum

How are the status and meaning of an artwork—whether an Ancient Greek statuary, a digital photograph, or an American naïve painting—altered through the creation of facsimiles, through exhibition, through the conversion of the object into image or code? How might reproduction, as an aesthetic strategy and a political act, present us with alternatives to the current, convoluted understanding of information as property? Media Replication Services will consist of presentations, performances, and provocations in response to these questions by artist William Pope.L, scholar Lisa Gitelman, and poet Caroline Bergvall, facilitated by Triple Canopy editors. The three participants will consider, as points of departure, forms of reproduction enacted in Triple Canopy’s 2014 Biennial installation, _Pointing Machines_.

Caroline Bergvall was the poet who 90% of people voted as 'bot' the other day... Coincidence...

**Tribeca Film Institute Interactive Reception (via Ida)**

7pm, 121 Varick St

The Tribeca Film Festival's [interactive  program](https://tribecafilminstitute.org/pages/2014_lineup)  is during the day, so that's out. If we want to go to the reception, I  can see about getting more RSVPs. I currently have 10 I think. There's  also [Storyscapes](https://tribecafilm.com/innovation/storyscapes)  earlier in the week. 

**[Theorizing the Web](http://theorizingtheweb.tumblr.com/2014/program), Friday and Saturday (via Casey)**

287 Kent Ave, Brooklyn

Theorizing the Web is an inter- and non-disciplinary  annual conference that brings together scholars, journalists, artists,  activists, and commentators to ask big questions about the  interrelationships between the Web and society. We deeply value public  engagement, and consider insights from academics, non-academics, and  non-“tech theorists” alike to be equally valuable. 

The first Theorizing the Web conference was held in 2011 at the University of Maryland, as was the second in 2012.  In 2013, the conference moved to New York, where it was hosted by the  CUNY Graduate Center in Manhattan. Theorizing the Web remains in New  York for 2014, but is excited to experiment with stepping outside of  institutional settings.

**Clement Valla - Transfer Gallery, Bushwick.** 

Open saturdays 2-7pm.

[Re/Mixed Media Festival IV](https://remixnyc.com)

The RE/Mixed Media Festival is a celebration of collaborative art-making and creative appropriation. It’s the artists’ contribution to the ongoing conversation about remixing, mashups, copyright law, fair use, and the freedom of artists to access their culture in order to add to and build upon it.

Now in it's fourth year, RE/Mixed Media Festival is a hybrid event -- a marriage of art exhibition and critical academic conference, a forum where artists, activists, scholars, musicians, writers, entertainment professionals, and policymakers come together to collectively re-examine the role of creative appropriation in the arts, and the roles of artists, government and industry in creating and maintaining a free and open culture.

RE/Mixed Media Festival IV is pleased to welcome media theorist Lev Manovich and author David Shields as keynote speakers, as well as the NY opening of DJ Spooky's international art and design exhibit, the Imaginary App. Other 2014 artists hail from 13 countries, and include 15 students, alumni, and faculty from the New School of Public Engagement's School of Media Studies and Parsons the New School for Design. Past artists and scholars have included Moby, Steinski, Ricky Powell, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Jesper Juul, Nitin Sawhney and over 150 other artists, performers, educators, activists, musicians and DJs.
