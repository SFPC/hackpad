**SMALL SUMMARY**

i just made a small dot point summary of things we've looked at. it's not exhaustive in any way, and includes projects and ideas of my own, but thought i'd share anyway. [Summary.rtf](https://www.dropbox.com/s/28m1zrn9nqzlz1h/Summary.rtf)

**Interviews**

I'm currently transcribing the short interviews we've done over the past few days. I want to present them visually somehow on Sunday so that people visiting can see them. If anyone has any ideas as to how I could do this/wants to help with the visual presentation, let me know.

Project for Monday 28 April

**Permutations Tweet Project**

Today I want to get started on an idea I have for a Twitter/Web project called **Four Letter Words**. It is inspired by that project 'Every Icon' that Zach showed us that goes through every combination of a grid of squares. Basically I want to make a website that runs through every combination of four letter words from AAAA to ZZZZ. This is: 456976. If I make a **bot** to tweet one of these every minute it would take me just less than a year. An issue I might have is getting suspended by Twitter for too much tweeting. An possible solution might be creating a website that has a counter - AAAA - that changes every minute, and only tweets those combinations that correspond to a word in the dictionary. If anyone is interested in helping out with this project let me know.

*   Log to the console combination of 3 letter and 4 letter words

*   Find out what is the maximum tweets per second for the bot
*   Design Layout

Tweepy: [](http://www.tweepy.org/)http://www.tweepy.org/ is an easy-to-use Python library for accessing the Twitter API.

*   learning how to scrape twitter for tweets with certain keywords, and then displaying them on a monitor in a continuous stream...

[Zach Lieberman](/ep/profile/AUZb6pnTdHj) brought in a book called Void by **Elodie Lareine. **It uses a multitude of text arranged in certain patterns, and when flipped, provides a visual 'narrative', or poem. Conceptually, it is indebted to Jorge Luis Borges story ['The Library of Babel'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel), in that it purports to be one of the books in the infinite library. Using text for visual representation made me think of old school ASCII art: imagine translating an entire movie, still by still, into text...etc...

[Taeyoon Choi](/ep/profile/uCZ3kD8pFvb) asked us to think of a game to play with Pierre Reverdy's poem, 'At Dawn'. For fun I was just using Chrome's speech-to-text function, which, as I'm sure you all know, isn't great. Here is a screen shot of my recitation of the poem and underneath is the original... Maybe we could use Arduino to do something funny like this... I don't know.

*   think about how to organise the data from bot or not
*   learn R and python
*   think about whether i could get a computer to play bot or not, whether a computer could be better at picking human poems from bot poems
*   create a constrained poetry writing device using tweets
*   make a piano that translates words into sound and vice versa
*   make a program that can generate poetry by listening to music
*   learn about sentiment text analysers
