Project Ideas 

*   Acoustical feedback as example of recursive functions, maybe with [drum feedback](http://www.zachdunham.com/drumfeedback)
*   Computer vision -> max/msp patch, reverse audio visualizer 
*   A/V feedback: Image's pixels mapped to oscillators, fft analyzes output, fft output updates pixels, loop.. 
*   Video feedback with mirrors, computer screen (what happens when a computer see's itself?)
*   3d printed ears 
*   Bone conduction headphones for sounds that are better felt, than heard 
*   Moire pattern rhythms (really just want to make syncopated beats with generative graphics) 
*   Programming language who's output is assembly for Atmel uC (alt to arduino IDE)
*   Freelancers timer. Simple desktop timer for freelancers. Possibly a simple geometric shape with a 3 axis accelerometer inside, different orientations start and stop your clock on different projects.  Or a set of reed switches with a pretty magnet to start and stop the different projects.  

Clojure Questions:

(= () (rest '(100))) why not? (= '(0 0) (rest '(100)))

(= 20 ((fn [f] (f 4 5))* )) feels like we're mixing pre-fix and post-fix 

(= 25 ( (fn [n] (* n n)))) what's going on here?  gotta pass 5 to fn.. 

questions:

http: put, post, get....ugh.  web feels ever expanding xml? 

animating text importing text files into oF

homebrew, what was that again??  

temboo
