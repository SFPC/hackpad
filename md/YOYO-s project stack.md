***Technical question**

*   learn openGL and shader language

*   how to use FBO

*   -I have been trying to put video input to sphere in GLSL.
*   my code seems somthing working now but it is not really going well.
*

*   how to set up xbee on arduino

*   -I want to make wirless sensor network for sending data to oF. 

*   how to send signal from openframeworks to Max

*

*   how to use arduino from openframeworks

*   -I want to use sensors to reflect my animetion on oF project. it is like 3D motion sensor to move box in screen.
*   -Firm hlped me with this. 
*   -[](https://github.com/firmread/ofArduinoExamples)https://github.com/firmread/ofArduinoExamples (this is very simplified example that firm made for easily use arduino with oF.)

*   aggressively tick that out for you since we did do this together :P
*   it worked well. thanks!

*   Audio analysis

*   can you also share some conceptual/ design/ story oriented questions here too? thanks
*   yes of course,I am trying to relate these technical questions to my project I am working on 

**<u>Audio input to change (generate) Shapes in oF</u>**

<u>idea</u>

audio analysis [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhUS2EZbj6g)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhUS2EZbj6g

<u>things to use for this project</u>

<u>necessary knowledge, question</u>

*   GLSL
*   how to make shapes with oF?

<u>input</u>

*   audio input (built-in maicrophone?)

<u>output</u>

**<u>Google Street Sound</u>**

**Walk around in NYC with sound (by controling with 3d accelerator)**

<u>idea </u>

I think that the sound in NYC is characteristic to me. I mean there are sounds of taxi, people talking, subway.....

I always imagine that I can walk around with characteristic sound in NY

1 record sound in NYC with location data

2 put sound data to oF project

3 explore NYC by controling the device which sends location

4 you can hear any sounds depending on your location.

<u>things to use for this project</u>

it's kind of similar to previous project.

*   openframeworks
*   arduino?

<u>necessary knowledge to get done this work and questions</u>

*   how to record sounds including location data

<u>input</u>

*   iphone(accelerometer)
*   arduino(accelerometer)

<u>output</u>

*   sound from iphone
