## FALL 2014

**Screw Lessons, Let's Go Wander Around**

Ground rules:

1.  All these excursions are completely optional. Join as many or as few as you like. 
2.  Put your name under the times you plan to join. Any number of people is fine and you can choose to join last minute as long as you follow the next two ground rules.
3.  Once you join us, you are  expected to stick it out until the end of that particular journey.  Coming and going together is part of the package.
4.  Be on time or the experience will leave without you. 

<undefined><li>**Tuesday, 1pm - 4pm**</li></undefined>

We'll go on a mellow journey to start. 

Departure from Orbital, ending in midtown.

## Summer 2014

**What I accomplished**

*   finished reading [Code by Charles Petzold](http://www.amazon.com/Code-Developer-Practices-Charles-Petzold-ebook/dp/B00JDMPOK2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1409768518&sr=8-1&keywords=code) 
*   Made a list of comp sci background reading to work through
*   did [Stanford Comp Sci 101](https://class.coursera.org/cs101-selfservice)  coursera class
*   Started [Harvard CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/), with an eye toward working my way through [this curriculum](http://blog.agupieware.com/2014/05/online-learning-bachelors-level.html) 
*   picked brains about city data, got tons of contacts, resources
*   Attempted [Stanford Cryptography 1](https://class.coursera.org/crypto-011) , bombed out pretty fast, but learned a lot!

maybe I should stop studying and start making stuff.... 

## SPRING 2014

**Project: NLP of SFPC Hackpad & Slack content**
<ul><li>Getting the hackpad content<ul><li>got the contents of the SFPC hackpad using [](https://github.com/Falicon/Python-Hackpad-API)https://github.com/Falicon/Python-Hackpad-API<ul><li>needed [this fix](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9810603/adding-install-requires-to-setup-py-when-making-a-python-package) at the top of the setup.py file</li>
<li>since this is a python library, i just needed to install it for it to work, didn't matter what file it was in in relation to the code i wrote</li>
<li>my client id and secret key didn't work, but zack's did. weird. code below for the app. this outputs markdown of all SFPC pads.</li>

*</ul class="code">

</ul class="code">

</ul class="code">

*   from hackpad_api import hackpad

*   temp = hackpad.Hackpad('sfpc','***client ID***','***secret***')
*   my_hackpads = temp.list_all()
*   for i in my_hackpads: 
*           content = temp.get_pad_content(i,'','md')
*           print content
*

*   now for text analysis. This looks promising: [Text Blob](http://textblob.readthedocs.org/en/dev/)

        *   can't sort out how to do sentiment analysis on an external file form the TextBlob documentation, trying this [tutorial](http://nealcaren.web.unc.edu/an-introduction-to-text-analysis-with-python-part-3/).

                *   ideas from tutorial: create a few word lists to check for, run the check on both hackpad and slack, compare results

                        *   how to count most frequent words?
            *   what layout will be interesting?
            *   what sets of words to look for? technical, subjective, curious, confused, friendly?

*   bailed on TextBlob and went with the tutorial results, can now process hackpad content against a list of positive and negative words, get a postivive & negative pergentage.

*   from __future__ import division
*   from string import punctuation
***   pads = open("SFPCHackpadContent.md").read()
*   pos_sent = open("positive.txt").read()
*   positive_words=pos_sent.split('\n')
*   pad_list = pads.split('# ')
*   positive_counts=[]
**   for pads in pad_list:
*           positive_counter=0
*           pads_processed=pads.lower()
*           for p in list(punctuation):
*                   pads_processed=pads_processed.replace(p,'')
*                   words=pads_processed.split(' ')
*           for word in words:
*                   if word in positive_words:
*                           #print word
*                           positive_counter=positive_counter+1
*           positive_counts.append(positive_counter/len(words))
*   print sum(positive_counts)/len(positive_counts)
*             

*   getting slack content - [](https://github.com/loisaidasam/pyslack)https://github.com/loisaidasam/pyslack

        *   never mind, trying this one - [](https://github.com/os/slacker)https://github.com/os/slacker

*   my slack client token - xoxp-2200409144-2299565691-2324405111-50f41f
*   got the json, not sure how to just pull out the text

results on hackpad analysis:

*   positive emotions - 0.175367936109
*   negative emotions - 0.160241935982
*   affection - 0.0
*   aggression - 0.0
*   anxiety - 0.0
*   aspirational - 0.0
*   auditory - 0.0
*   mental - 0.0
*   physical - 0.15111643377
*   sadness - 0.0
*   visual - 1.55359981011e-05

uninteresting on its own - need something to compare it too, gotta get this info out of slack for a comparison... but dirty data is so dirty!

**Main goals**

*   get over a programming hump of just doing basic mark up stuff to actually doing OO stuff or whatever that needs to look like. 
*   collect a profusion of touchstones for creative mashups of archival material, documentary material, narrative, and built space. (can get more clear about that later....) 

        *   locations in memory, placemaking? retrieving info from memory with c++, cultural excavation?

*   set up a node application on a raspberry pi that does some physical output based on live data pulled from an internet api
*   get familiar with different kinds of darknets and mesh nets

**Misc questions**

*   How do hex numbers work?
*   What's the difference between GPU and CPU?

*   What are some good venues to keep in touch with creative computation after SFPC? (some answers: NYC Resistor, Eyebeam (soon to be in Industry City), 

*   What's wrong with hosting your own etherpad?

*   Can [Casey Gollan](/ep/profile/CEJSxiJcUGe) do an ownCloud workshop since DropBox is evil?

*   how do cross compiling & distributed compiling work?

*   I can show rpi cross compiling if you want -- it's essentially getting a toolchain that compiled code for another platform.  [](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_compiler)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_compiler  If you use OF on OSX, for example and compile an IOS app, you are cross compiling (compiling on intel but for an ARM chip).  Usually it requires getting a basic set of tools (compilier / linker) in place. 

**Code to grapple with**

 ([for printing](https://github.com/joelpt/sublimetext-print-to-html))

*   [goto fail Apple's SSL bug](http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2014/02/24/anatomy-of-a-goto-fail-apples-ssl-bug-explained-plus-an-unofficial-patch/) (via [Zach Lieberman](/ep/profile/AUZb6pnTdHj))
*   [Towers of Hanoi](http://runnable.com/UqfbDH51LRNwAAHE/solve-towers-of-hanoi-using-recursion-in-c%2B%2B-for-recursive) (via [Zach Lieberman](/ep/profile/AUZb6pnTdHj))
*   [Conway's Game of Life](http://runnable.com/UwQvQY99xW5AAAAQ/john-conway-s-game-of-life-for-c%2B%2B-nested-for-loops-and-2-dimensional-arrays) (via [Zach Lieberman](/ep/profile/AUZb6pnTdHj))

**Misc observations**

*   participation in a robust community is a good substitute for leaning on robust documentation
*   I really underestimate how much I know
*   Computer memory is some weird mix of the Wild West and early 20th century Egypt 
*   Manovic makes really terrible sex jokes 
*   if you're playing with tech that could be construed as malicious, publicizing your intentions as an artist is a good idea. 
*   now that things like python, node, json, c++, etc. are familiar to me, there's a huge sea of code to work with on github. i don't need to be that versed in the languages to get things working!
*   good documentation makes all the difference

**APIs stuff**

*   See Jonathan's Hackpac [Introduction to Nodejs](/9U8LZjRNj7v) for getting at apis and doing things with them on raspberry pi
*   [Jonathan's Internet workshop notes](https://sfpc.hackpad.com/the-internets-hqAiuJMmBGV) 
*   [Intro course on APIs](https://zapier.com/learn/apis/) 

*   review Node tutorial on Lynda.com
*   Explore packages in node - [](https://eirikb.github.io/nipster)[https://eirikb.github.io/nipster](https://eirikb.github.io/nipster)
*   get inspired with examples of projects done with NYC Open Data - [](http://nycopendata.tumbler.com)[http://nycopendata.tumbler.com](http://nycopendata.tumbler.com/)
*   Nose around NYC Gov Data - [](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/)https://nycopendata.socrata.com/ -  endpoint info at [](http://dev.socrata.com/docs/endpoints.html)[http://dev.socrata.com/docs/endpoints.html](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/)
*   pick a dataset and brainstorm interesting physical outputs
*   Bonus: set up some [casper](http://casperjs.org/) stuff for [](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dob/html/home/home.shtml)[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dob/html/home/home.shtml](http://casperjs.org/)

**Placemaking**

touchstones for creative mashups of archival material, documentary material, narrative, and built space
