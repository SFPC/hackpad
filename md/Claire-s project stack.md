![](https://hackpad-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/hackpad.com_YDEguYTyVJZ_p.78007_1381869928225_keanu_mockup.gif) 

**Idea:**

*   Play on _The Matrix_/Baudrillard's theories on simulacra
*   Explore the hyperreality of pop culture / exaltation of culture icons 

**Project:**

*   Pepper's ghost of Keanu Reeves video collage (in small box?) – need to test quality in different sizes

**To do:**

*   Get materials to test best outcome (flat glass, lexan polycarbonate sheet, thinner plexiglass, grey scrim)
*   Edit video pieces – test speed of videos (slowed-down?) + if full body is more effective than cropped/close-ups (gaze)

## 2. The Rules of Attraction

![](https://hackpad-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/hackpad.com_YDEguYTyVJZ_p.78007_1382392014908_rj_mockup_v2.png)

**Idea:**

*   Simulation of desire / disembodied intimacy
*   Disruption of fantasy
*   The death of romance (a theme from Bret Easton Ellis' _The Rules of Attraction_) explored through materializing the spatiality of a couple's initial meeting
*   Appropriating the scene from _Romeo and Juliet _(1996) – nostalgia/invented worlds as fascimile for the real
*   Explore the affective qualities of physical space

**Project:**

*   Two projected video feeds that allow the viewer to literally + physically walk through a scene of a movie. Videos react to location of the viewer, as if the actor's gaze was following the viewer. When there is no one in the space, they are looking at each other.

**To do:**

*   Figure out how to track heads/blobs in OF with the PS3 Eye, then put on Raspberry Pis
*   Build prototype of projections in space to see where the "gaze" of each video should land 

## 3. Programming language (Amit's class)

**Project:**

*   Programming language assignment from [Amit Pitaru](/ep/profile/tkesLTea5Bv)'s class
*   Hackpad: [Parsed Poetry Programming Language](https://sfpc.hackpad.com/Smv7hWK8gsV) with Moises [Sanabria](https://sfpc.hackpad.com/ep/profile/v6pSS8EP8fM) and [Jason Levine](https://hackpad.com/ep/profile/AFiCS26Bowb) and [Jonathan Wohl](/ep/profile/rdI4x5fVNUz)

**To do:**

*   Finalize syntax and how IDE would work
*   Wireframe + design IDE
*   Name + brand + any other design needs?

## 4. Control Structure Diorama (Zach's class)

**Project:**

*   Control Structure education tool from [Zach Lieberman](https://sfpc.hackpad.com/ep/profile/AUZb6pnTdHj)'s class
*   Hackpad: [Control Structures Metaphor](/LiStJkue6OI) with [Jonathan Dahan](https://hackpad.com/ep/profile/DhjrLUvCSc6)

**Idea:**

*   Simulated paradise, in an object

**Project:**

*   A pineapple made up of mirrors. 

**To do:**

**Idea:**

*   Simulated paradise, in the form of an infinite drink maker

**Project:**

*   Infinite drink maker, like a fountain. The zombie glass would empty out into a repository that feeds back into the drink shaker which would then shake the drink liquid up before pouring back into the glass.

**To do:**

*   Get materials: Glass, shaker, drink materials, motor?
