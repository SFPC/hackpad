**Organizational**

*   What are the building hours?

        *   24/7, though Floor 3 may be locked when no Orbital members are there

*   What are we looking for?

**Learning **

*   To what extent will we be required to teach one and another?

**Social **

*   What are some populations / demographics / groups that are left behind or harmed by current technological progress?
*   Is technological divide or increased inequality inevitable?

**Philosophy**

*   Why poetics?  Where does it fit in with computation/programming on a minute to minute day to day interaction basis? 

**Computation / Code**

*   What assumptions do we make when using a high level programming language? i.e what do we not necessarily _have _ to understand? 
*   Is there a crash course in OpenFrameworks?

*   I am looking for references around programming systems for drawing?  Suggestions?  (the Kyle McDonald example was great)
*   Who (out in the world) is doing really interesting work?

**Techniques**

**Technology**

*   How is work presented & reviewed?
*   What is a successful class from the perspective of SFPC?
*   What are the unspoken rules? (could they be written?)
*   How will OF be taught?  Is there a electronics or hardware class?
*   How do people make the "cool stuff" - not in a conceptual way, but in more of a 'nuts & bolts' sort of way (tools, process, structure, tools, location, people, critique/review cycles, what happens first and then next) - for things like drones w/ LED, eyewriter, various beautiful websites, weather worlds, etc
*   how do designers approach problems?  How to "think like a designer"?  What are small things that make things look good?
*   How can we use these new skills to make a difference in the world?
*   How do you set expectations as a freelancer?
*   Even when we bring together a super talented, motivated group of people from a variety of backgrounds to learn/create, what are the educational challenges that we still face as a school and how do we overcome them? 
*   What guidance do people have for creating your portfolio (specifically how the work is shared, rather than creating the work to be shared)?
*   What are best practices for approaching a new project, version control, documentation, repeatability, setting goals, giving/getting feedback in your (both teachers & students) own work?
*   Can this serve as a model for education (teaching/learning/creating/research) in other settings?
*   How do we make both giving and getting critique/feedback a part of our culture?
*   What can we do to help make this as awesome as possible?  What do you need from us?  
*   How can we make technology about people and not about technology?
*   Does quantification, if used smartly, ultimately feel qualitative?
