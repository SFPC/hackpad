**<u>I want to learn:                                                                                                                  </u>**

1.  how to get openframeworks for iOS up and running -- hopefully this will happen soon-- before your class but just thought i'd mention it in case someone can help with this. (still looking for an update to the simulator!)
2.  are there things we should know about the difference between oF for mac and iOS?
3.  how to setup UI elements-- i take it it doesnt use an .xib file or storyboards as with standard cocoa framework?
4.  how to integrate oF with standard iOS app using cocoa framework (combining obj.c & c++)

Shortcuts for all of the code signing and certificates for iOS development devices

(andy-- i think this is standard ie. not particular to oF-- we can talk about it tomorrow:)
