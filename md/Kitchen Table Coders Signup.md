Questionsï¼š

*    I use the newest Xcode, do I need to install the 4.6 as you mentioned? 
*   would be good if you have 4.6 in parralel. If not, might be interesting to see if it works with latest.

From Ted:

Yes, please make sure everyone installs Pd-extended from here:

[](http://puredata.info/downloads/pd-extended)[http://puredata.info/downloads/pd-extended](http://puredata.info/downloads/pd-extended)

And ask if anyone has specific things they want to do or learn about!

2.  Tega - Python and pure data.
3.  Mini - Python & data
