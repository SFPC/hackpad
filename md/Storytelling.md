# Storytelling

exercises

*   blindfold some kids, drop them off in safe areas, make them come back with a story
*   find some paintings in a museum, ask to construct a story of what happened just before the painting

poetry and storytelling

*   in a story, you are not lost as to where you are in the story
*   poetry is made of images, but don't need to explain where you are or what it is
*   poetry is not using logic, maybe a connection to the image more emotional than intellectual

making stories

*   consider your editors hitmen, they are there to kill your darlings
