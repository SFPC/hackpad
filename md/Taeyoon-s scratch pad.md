# Taeyoon's scratch pad

my friend Lauren McCarthy asked if I can illustrate for [P5.JS](http://p5js.org/)

I'm using my residency at CMU [Studio for Creative Inquiry](http://studioforcreativeinquiry.org/) to focus on illustrating about processing and javascript, which is both subjects that I'm not familiar with.  

I'll addd interesting links on this pad as well as some  work in progress, in hope to continue feeling SFPC vibe in my week away from school. I'm happy for your suggestions and comments and corrections. 

**meeting notes 11.16**

**Some ideas for the drawings**

*   Illustration of key concepts - graphic storytelling to help readers focus, or find interest in dry topcis
*   Commentary on learning to program, like general frustration and specifically for js. lots of jokes from programmers who give me tips about learning to code. 
*   Informations I had to look around the Internet and other books to understand the topics that were covered in p5.js book. 

**Projects**

What are some good achievable goals for a person learning p5.js might make? using the contents of the book? 

*   internet post-it? post your note online on website? 
*   dynamic archive of the comics? - for me to feel inspired. this helps 
*   poetry generator? - sfpc type hopework 
*   comic puppet? - me want to make.

The drawing above was to help thinking about what is behind websites we use. When newbie starts looking into p5.js there are too many technical terms. I think it's important to demystify the terms by breaking them into bite size information.

I was reading the p5dom and realized I don't really know what DOM is. and also the description on the page doesn't really explain it.

The DOM stuff is gonna lead into this page.

which is not very simple cuz it has lots of programming concepts that has not been explicitly explained so far.

Background like ECMAscript.. this might be too wordy.

How to make Murata's Melter in processing?

What are the key algorithms involved in making something similar, using the code that's introduced in getting started with p5.js book?
