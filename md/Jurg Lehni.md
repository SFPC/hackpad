*   Anything can be your material, you can cook with simple gradients and this amazing thing happens.
*   Absolute simple thing, find a gesture and making it visible.
*   I don't want the program to do more than it needs to do.
*   Don't want to make programs that make things by itself.
*   Instead something transparent and doesn't scare you.
*   I don't think I'm nostalgic I just like the transparency of early periods of technology.
*   Less inspired by a shiny surface that is more of a blackbox.
*   Making software the doesn't have to have a specific purpose.
*   There should be a special therapist for technologist.
