*   **Technological Parts**
*   What kind of difference does the technology my take on JS Joust compared to Turtle Wushu?
*   The technology is also a judge. << trust on the computer
*   More socially acceptable.
*   Technology can encourage playfulness? Not having technology can encourage playfulness?

**Game Controllers/Interfaces**

*   Limited way of interacting with games through just controllers.
*   There are so many ways you can react to things.
*   With digital games it's always going to be in the screen.
*   With physical digital games the story can exist outside the screen.

**HIT ME project**

button on the cap

*   **precedents**

*   twister
*   sumo
*   fencing
*   Van Damme is Lionheart << movie as a great way to help imagine your game

>> Personal Injury Waiver form, legal and also mental entry point to the game

**Magic Circle** - game design principle of behaviors that are not socially acceptable in normal society are sanctioned by the game. Originally defined in [Homo Ludens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_Ludens_(book))

*   The whole experience from the player entering that world, and the preparation for them to be playing the game until the end of the experience. Is not the game itself but the game the experience that surrounds them.

*   Guitar hero as simulation of awesomeness
*   Rhythm game about timing
*   Similar to Patty Cake
*   Created controllers for it with arduinos.
*   each glove have different voltage ID as the way to track which glove is which
*   XML of clap combo(!!?)

**Costumes as Game Controllers**

*   Cosplay and [LARPing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action_role-playing_game)
*   The way that people create realationships with an avatar.

        *   One you start wearing a costume you can start playing the role of the avatar.
    *   They become game controllers.

*   technical: Yoyo board + android >> osc >> processing on mac

**Simple Globe Controllers**

*   A way to start brining these experiences out of the screen.

**closing thought**

*   experience first technic later
*   more human centric, not techno centric
*   decoration as part of the narrative

**in two player setting **

each glove had different voltage output

only one of the glove is sensing at a specific time

each glove takes turn to sense in a very fast loop
