**Communication**

*   Switch address to Taeyoon's house
*   Move mailing list from Dreamhost to Mailchimp

*   is this because of the new site?  I really dislike mailchimp and other $$ mail services.
*   its free depending on list size but I know what you mean. Anything where we can share access would be good, so that going forward I can send announcements without nagging you. 

**Buy**
