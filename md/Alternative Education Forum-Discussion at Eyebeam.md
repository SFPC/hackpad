Moises and I participated tonight in the Kitchen Table Coders w/Amit and afterwards began talking about leading an alternative education experiment at Eyebeam. 

(love this idea ) 

We're interested in leading an experiment with several different discussions and activities taking place and then afterwards having a forum/discussion about it-- what worked, what didnt and then ways in which we can influence the future of alternative education in tech.

If anyone is interested in joining us for brainstorming or if you think you might be interested to help organize and participate in the discourse, we will be speaking tomorrow, Wed.,

-- 4pm-5pm!

(Cant join but interested and wanted to teach something at eyebeam. I can join later also. 4pm ish)** Just changed the time so you can join also, Mini!**

*   One think to think about is facilitatin visitors that come in, its right in the middle of chelsea people com in there accidently, what is this building with spraypain on the fron, how do we deal with outsiders, facilitating the guest into the space, important for the days of the wrokshop. Greeting people and showing the work in progress and final projects.
*   We would be able to tell our story better than others.
