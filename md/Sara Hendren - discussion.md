 [All Technology is Assistive](https://medium.com/backchannel/all-technology-is-assistive-ac9f7183c8cd). (That piece has just been updated and republished on Medium.)

 [The White Cane as Technology](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/11/the-white-cane-as-technology/281167/).

 For Zach D: Neil Harbisson, [I Listen to Color](http://www.ted.com/talks/neil_harbisson_i_listen_to_color?language=en). Uses bone conduction and sensory substitution.
<ul class="comment"><li> (I have some thoughts / doubts about this project, please ask me offline....  I think the goals are super interesting)</li>
<li>Thanks for sharing this Sara H!  I chatted with Neil this past year - fun project.  [Zach Lieberman](/ep/profile/AUZb6pnTdHj), yes. let's talk.</li>
<li>Very interested to hear more! I actually haven't watched the TED talk (kinda allergic to the form, along with so many other folks, I know), so this makes me want to examine it further.</li>
<li>This is nice. Hadn't seen this piece before [](http://vimeo.com/19207943)http://vimeo.com/19207943

*   Hadn't seen either of those. Thank you! Beautiful. And it recalls for me the analogous extended function in [Rebecca Horn's "Finger Gloves" piece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0uNnmAudmk#t=48).

For Lauren and anyone else interested in gender stuff: On breast implants, the politics of feminine embodiment, race, [and more](http://ablersite.org/2012/07/12/a-real-form-audre-lorde/).

A video game with [nothing to see](http://ablersite.org/2013/12/09/a-video-game-with-nothing-to-see/). Interesting use of disability to tweak the default way games are designed.

 One more video: my RISD student Bec Conrad's "Power Shoes" project that I mentioned in our session. I just saw Bec again, so I asked her for the link to her final video. Love this.
