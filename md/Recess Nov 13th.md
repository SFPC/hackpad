**Green roof of the Bronx County Courthouse**

[The Bronx leads NYC in green roofs](http://www.welcome2thebronx.com/wordpress/2014/02/26/the-bronx-continues-to-lead-the-city-in-green-technology-construction-now-home-to-largest-solar-panel-installation-in-nyc/), and the Bronx County Courthouse is the only municipal building in New York City with a green roof. The floor below this green roof [reports a 30% decrease](http://designtrust.blogspot.com/2008/06/south-bronx-green-roof-tour.html) in power use for AC and heating. This one has been here since 2006.

[Snug Harbor](http://snug-harbor.org/) was a sailor's retirement home. It was busy in the 19th century and fell into decline with the advent of social security in the 20th century.

*   Sailors’ Snug Harbor was established in 1801 by the will of Capt. Randall, a wealthy landowner and the namesake of Randall Manor, who bequeathed his 22-acre estate to create the haven for “aged, decrepit and worn-out sailors.” Randall’s extensive real estate holdings in downtown Manhattan underwrote the home for 144 years.
*   It admitted fragile or impoverished mariners from across the country “regardless of their race, sex, nationality, religion or physical condition.”
*   The first of the “Front Five” Greek Revival buildings along Richmond Terrace was the Main Hall, opened in 1833, and home to 37 men. The milky gray stone that forms the building was quarried and cut by prisoners at Sing Sing, and brought to Snug Harbor by boat. The buildings are considered some of the finest examples of Greek Revival style in the country.
*   Sailor’s Snug Harbor reached its heyday toward the turn of the 20th century, when more than 1,000 seafarers lived there. They were referred to by the surrounding Island community as “snugs.”

As with most institutions established in the 19th century, it needed to maintain it's own utilities. There is a defunct power plant on the property and underground tunnels. The tunnels could have presumably have carried steam from the power plant to other buildings on the complex. Currently, the tunnels are under renovation and new pipes are being laid.

**Staten Island Railway**

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/01/SIRT_map.jpg)

Currently, there is one subway line in operation in Staten Island running along the east shore. The north shore and south beach lines [ceased passenger operation in 1953](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staten_Island_Railway) in favor of city operated buses. The North Shore line carried freight traffic until 1991. Now it rots way.
