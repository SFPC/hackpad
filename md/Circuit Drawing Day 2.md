*   You are able to make a really complex system with a very simple mechanism.
*   The aesthetic of DIY and punk

        *   The other endpoint is HD and high end is more aesthetic than artistic.

*   At the end what you want to do with the medium is what matters.

**Craft**

**Low Tech**

*   More accessible.
*   Somethings wont fail if there is no battery.
*   How can you make it so that a kid can understand it.
*   Audience can become stunned with the technology.

**Information and Communication**

*   Different ways of encoding informations.
*   Binary is the most efficient for encoding digital information.
*   Logics circuit and flow of electricity.
*   When making a project how is information going to be encoded and how does the user interact with it. #question
*   Levels of abstraction between communication and information.

*   There are two chips on every nintendo one with the artwork and one with the data.

        *   Wrote his own application and used his cloud sprite.
    *   If you are an engineer you might think this is not hacking.

                *   Is it just as strong?

*   A combination of a resistor and capacitor is called an RC network.
*   People have been building computers based on this book.
*   Taeyoon was trying to build a [4bit computer](https://www.google.com/search?q=4+bit+computer&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS573US573&es_sm=119&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=G31aU6rgO-2-sQS3woHgAw&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&biw=1280&bih=702) over the summer.

**How did I get into Low Level Electronics**

*   You dont need computer science to do that.
*   It was all logic based.
*   Made sense to build it low level.
