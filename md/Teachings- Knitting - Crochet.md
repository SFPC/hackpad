Flower (2 colors)

1.  To begin: Chain 7.
2.  Connect the ends of the chain by using a slip stitch to connect your current stitch to the first stitch you made.
3.  Chain 2.
4.  Double crochet 11 stitches into the middle of the ring/circle you made in previous step. All stitches will go through middle hole of the ring/circle. (You should have 12 stitches in total around the ring/circle: the first 2 chains act as one double crochet.)
5.  Connect first double crochet stitch to 12th double crochet stitch with a slip stitch. Cut, tie, and weave in ends.
6.  Take your other color and do a slip stitch to get it onto your hook.
7.  Insert your hook between 2 of the 12 double crochets and chain 2.
8.  Triple crochet 2 more stitches into the same place.
9.  Take your hook out of the current stitch's loop and put it through the top of your first 2 chains.
10.  Take the tip of last triple crochet by grabbing it with your hook and pulling it through the top of the first two chains. (This makes the petal look a little bit 3D.)
11.  Chain 2.
12.  Double crochet 1 stitch into the next spot (between 2 double crochets) and then triple crochet 2 more. Repeat steps i-k.
13.  Repeat step k for every spot around the ring/circle. 
14.  When last petal has been made, connect to first petal using a slip stitch.
15.  Cut, tie and weave in ends.
