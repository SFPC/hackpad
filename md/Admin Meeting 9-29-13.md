*   Classes are going well! Lucky to have this group of students.

*   Jen is doing her first dinner class on Thursday: chili.
*   Taeyoon's classes are going well and he says Amit's are great.

        *   Zach and Taeyoon will both be at sfpc 3 days a week, overlapping.

                *   Zach: Mon - Wed
        *   Taeyoon: Wed - Fri
        *   but they might swap from time-to-time

        *   Casey can do Mondays and at least another full day/day-and-a-half during the week. Flexible but trying to work < 2.5 days /wk this fall b/c of Bruce fellowship.

*   Working out server space now, can set up a folder like [](http://spfc.io/2013/fall/)http://spfc.io/2013/fall/ for anything to go in (or maybe subdomain would be better?)

        *   Kinda underused right now
    *   Taeyoon will write our first weeknote on the Tumblr
    *   A bunch of students started their own SFPC tumblrs/are documenting things on Twitter. It would be cool to aggregate/archive all of that.
    *   Everyone is down to share/publish lesson plans/resources online. 
    *   Could rotate the official Twitter between students like [](http://twitter.com/sweden)[http://twitter.com/sweden](http://twitter.com/sweden) :-)

*   Students talked about building tools, which would be sweet, but we shouldn't get totally distracted doing that.
