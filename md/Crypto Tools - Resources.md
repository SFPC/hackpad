    2.  download [enaigmail](https://www.enigmail.net/home/index.php) plugin for thunderbird

2.  Open thunderbird - in 'Tools / Addons / Extensions manually add the plugin and restart![](https://hackpad-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/hackpad.com_vZjrEzfgnhv_p.252113_1415218435510_Screen Shot 2014-11-05 at 3.12.04 PM.png)

## tor

1) download tor from [](https://www.torproject.org)https://www.torproject.org and install

        * automatically opens a new browser using tor 'congrats'

2) can set up addresses for specific sites - [](http://kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion/)http://kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion/ (hidden wiki) or decqjr53xivw7zjp.onion

        * set up under settings/services then add a new webpage/site - generates the key seen above

        * tails is similar but allows you to serve an entire site through [](https://tails.boum.org/)https://tails.boum.org/

* tor will let you operate anonymously on the web until you log in to a site - good for browsing, not posting
