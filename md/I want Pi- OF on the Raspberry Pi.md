# I want Pi: OF on the Raspberry Pi

**Equipment List**

*   router

        *   ethernet cables? or wifi?

**Workshop Outline**

1.  Introduce ourselves, help people get setup (?), gauge experience.
2.  Intro to OF & Raspberry Pi

        1.  What is OF good at?
    2.  What is the Pi good at?
    3.  And with their forces combined...

3.  **Very Briefly** walk through setup of Raspberry Pi

        1.  we won't be performing this setup during the workshop, but I think it's good to go through it with people so that there's no mystery.
    2.  describe difference between building in XCode and on pi (demonstrate make on Mac)

4.  Describe workflow

        1.  Option A: SAMBA

                1.  Mount the Pi on your computer
        2.  If you're on a fast connection, edit the files directly
        3.  If the connection is slow, edit a copy then move it to the Pi

        2.  Option B: Git + SSH

                1.  Develop and test on your computer
        2.  Push working code to git repo
        3.  From SSH session

5.  Walk through the osc skeleton code. Maybe we should build it together as a group since it's so simple, each one writing it individually?
6.  Show a couple examples of ways it could be used.
7.  Pair up participants, help them build something cool.
