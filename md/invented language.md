# invented language

i'm finding it difficult to imagine how i might be able to communicate how to draw a circle to something that didn't already know what a circle was. any help?

think about instructing a child (or someone that doesn't know a circle) to make a circle in a physical way, ie, "Take this piece of string.  Pin it to this point. wrap the string around your pen and pull the pen so the string is taught, move the pen counter clockwise and draw until you hit the starting point."   There's other ways -- for example, start this point, make a tiny line, rotate a tiny bit, make another tiny line, rotate a bit, etc.   The instructions help you understand what sort of data you might need (length of the string, ie "radius", position of the pin "x" and "y", color of the pen, etc) 

thanks zach. that helps a lot. i'm thinking about a robot compass now, that dances to music...
