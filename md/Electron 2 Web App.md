## Math

*   Counting Mechanisms

        *   The development of number systems can be seen as an early tool to help people keep track of commmodities and property.
    *   notches on sticks or marks on walls.
    *   Counting Boards
    *   Familiar Frame Based Abacus
    *   Abacus

                *   multiples of ten
        *   relatively few beads are required to depic large numbers.
        *   An abacus is a memory aid for the user making mental calculations, as opposed to the true mechanical calculating machines which were still to come.
        *   Not much progress was made to automate counting.

*   Numerous Mathematical Formulae and Theorems

        *   Simplified mathematical operations.
    *   Tables of Integrals, Logarithms, and Trigonometry.
    *   All newly discovered math had to be worked out by hand.
    *   Accuracy unchecked until machines could generate the tables in far less time and with more accuracy than a team of humans could ever hope to achieve.

*   Table of Logarythms

        *   Logarythmic Scale

*   BInary

        *   Binary representation was going to prove important in the future design of computers which took advantage of a multitude of two-state devices such card readers, electric circuits which could be on or off, and vacuum tubes.

*   HexCode

## Mechanical

*   Pascaline 1642

        *   First Mechanical Adding Machine in 1642 based on a design described by Hero of Alexandria.

                *   Used to add up the distance a carriage travelled.
        *   The basic principle of his calculator is still used today in water meters and modern day odometers.
        *   first signs of technophobia emerged with mathematicians fearing the loss of their jobs due to progress.

*   Analytical Engine & Difference Machine

        *   The analytical engine was a real parallel decimal computer which would operate on words of 50 decimals and was able to store 1000 such numbers.

*   Hollerith & Tabulating Machine 1890

        *   A step toward automated computation was the introduction of punched cards, which were first successfully used in connection with computing in 1890 by Herman Hollerith working for the U.S. Census Bureau.
    *   As a result of his invention, reading errors were consequently greatly reduced, work flow was increased, and, more important, stacks of punched cards could be used as an accessible memory store of almost unlimited capacity; furthermore, different problems could be stored on different batches of cards and worked on as needed. Hollerith's tabulator became so successful that he started his own firm to market the device; this company eventually became International Business Machines (IBM).
    *   strictly limited to tabulation

*   Turing Machine 1936

        *   The Turing machine was designed to perform logical operations and could read, write, or erase symbols written on squares of an infinite paper tape. This kind of machine came to be known as a finite state machine because at each step in a computation, the machine's next action was matched against a finite instruction list of possible states.

*   Z3 Konrad Zuse 1941

        *   first programmable computer designed to solve complex engineering equations.
    *   it was also the first machine to work on the binary system, as opposed to the more familiar decimal system.
    *   Binary representation was going to prove important in the future design of computers which took advantage of a multitude of two-state devices such card readers, electric circuits which could be on or off, and vacuum tubes.

*   The Von Neumann Machine

        *   data and prgram can be stored in the same space. Thus the machine itself ca alter either its program or its internal dat.
    *   Conditional goto's to other points in the code
    *   Stored Program Techniques

                *   The primary advance was the provision of a special type of machine instruction called conditional control transfer--which permitted the program sequence to be interrupted and reinitiated at any point, similar to the system suggested by Babbage for his analytical engine--and by storing all instruction programs together with data in the same memory unit, so that, when desired, instructions could be arithmetically modified in the same way as data. Thus, data was the same as program.

        *   This group included computers using random access memory (RAM), which is a memory designed to give almost constant access to any particular piece of information. These machines had punched-card or punched-tape input and output devices and RAMs of 1,000-word.

*   EDVAC (Electronic Discrete Varaible Automatic Computer)

        *   The vacuum tube, used up to this time in almost all the computers and calculating machines. A zero could then be represented by the absence of an electron current to the plate; the presence of a small but detectable current to the plate represented a one.
    *   This would be possible because EDVAC was going to have more internal memory than any other computing device to date. Memory was to be provided through the use of mercury delay lines. The idea being that given a tube of mercury, an electronic pulse could be bounced back and forth to be retrieved at will--another two state device for storing 0s and 1s. This on/off switchability for the memory was required because EDVAC was to use binary rather than decimal numbers, thus simplifying the construction of the arithmetic units.

*   Transistor 1947

        *   Freedom from vacuum tubes.

*   Integrated Circuit 1958

        *   Allowed the placement of many transistors into a small area.

## Analog

## Digital

*   Operating System
*   Languages High and Low
*   ASCII turning binary into text
*   Basic (Beginners all purpose symbolic Instructoinal code).

        *   BASIC was designed to provide an interactive, easy method for upcoming computer scientists to program computers.

*   FORTRAN, developed by a team of IBM programmers, was one of the first high- level languages--languages in which the programmer does not have to deal with the machine code of 0s and 1s. It was designed to express scientific and mathematical formulas. For a high-level language, it was not very easy to program in. Luckily, better languages came along.
*   ALGOL--ALGOrithmic Language. ALGOL was intended to be a universal, machine-independent language, but they were not successful as they did not have the same close association with IBM as did FORTRAN. A derivative of ALGOL-- ALGOL-60--came to be known as C, which is the standard choice for programming requiring detailed control of hardware.
*   After that came COBOL--COmmon Business Oriented Language. COBOL was developed in 1960 by a joint committee. It was designed to produce applications for the business world and had the novice approach of separating the data descriptions from the actual program. This enabled the data descriptions to be referred to by many different programs.
*   In the late 1960s, a Swiss computer scientist, Niklaus Wirth, would release the first of many languages. His first language, called Pascal, forced programmers to program in a structured, logical fashion and pay close attention to the different types of data in use. He later followed up on Pascal with Modula-II and III, which were very similar to Pascal in structure and syntax.
*   Graphical User Interfaces
*   Can run thousands of different sets of instrcutions.

The Hidden Language of Computer and Software

Chapter 18

*   Thoughout recorded history people have invented numberous clever gadgets and machines in a universal quest to make mathematical calculations just a little bit easier. #computational[T](/ep/search/?q=%23computationalrend&via=kYLqkhKJCQ0)rend
*   While the human species seemingly has an innate numerical ability, we also require frequent assitance. We can often conceive of problems that we can't easily figure solve ourselves. #createTools #mentalModels #abstraction
*   If you've designed an adding machine that does everything except the carry, you're nowhere close to being finished! #limitation
