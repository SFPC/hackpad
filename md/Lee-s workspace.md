# Lee's workspace

**working:**

*   github, irc

*   twitter bot (server scripting)

*   better ways to create filters for images/camera in OF and processing

*   building new GUI styles

**project ideas:**

1.  create a [steve roggenbuck](http://livemylief.com) twitter bot  _(small idea, for fun and to learn server scripting)_
2.  create audio graffiti/fake looping mp3 radio stations

1.  create framework for playable public choose-yr-own-adventure style games

1.  a raspPi-based arcade machine for playing DIY art games

1.  creating playable applications/games that generate art and music

**Project Documentation:**

sorry my iphone camera sucks

**Day 4**

_Write some kind of data visualization using an API combining 2 pieces of  data and doing something with that data._

**Day 3**

_Delve into some new-to-you programming languages and write a program in them._

On the bus up to NYC on Saturday I built a Rothko painting generator in Processing. I love minimal / modern colorfield painting. And I want to make generators for this kind of art. I created a port in OpenFrameworks since I haven't really made my own program in OF before. I have much more to work on, but porting this only took me maybe 45 minutes or so. It generates a random Rothko style minimal rectangle painting and alters it over time. New rectangles are generated  and overwrite with gradual shifts in color over time.

Next I downloaded ChipmunkBasic. I've always wanted to mess with BASIC. As a kid I borrowed BASIC programming books from the library and was sad when I couldn't get BASIC to work on my Mac. So I'm super excited that this is an extremely basic port of the 1977-1990 style BASIC language. I found code from 1977(!) to create a dice roller and modified it. 

**Provocation 2**

_Create a poem that 15 of us can use together_

Poem For Cellphones

all poets to be arranged in a circle, more or less. at command, all poets take out their phones and open their text messages. any poet can start, picking their last received message and stating it aloud. the poet to his or her left then begins to read their last received text message. thereafter, poets continue around the circle clockwise, stating their own last received message. this continues around the circle until everyone has had a chance to say their last received text message out loud. once the original speaker-poet's turn comes up again, he or she reads the last text message they sent to someone else. poets continue around in a circle until all of them have read the last text message they sent to someone.

Our first assignment was to design a new programming language and then write code to draw a triangle in a circle in a square. I designed a programming language/system built on hobo signs. There is a system of hobo signs that were used especially in the heydays of hobo'ing (!) and many of these have been listed and can be found online. In my language, you start by writing your own hobo moniker (a logo that represents you) along with the date and any comment you have. Next, you indicate which direction is North. To indicate when to "draw" I use the dig symbol. Then to indicate how far to go, I actually indicate how many days and nights to walk in that direction. So distance is clearly not precise in this language. That's the series of open and filled circles in lines above. Each section ends with double diamonds ("quiet") to indicate when to stop digging (drawing). There's also a sleep command in between each section. The program ends with the stop command and then the train symbol, which indicates a good place to "catch out" or hitch a ride out of the program.

On the first day, my team drew the prompt "Design a computer for a tree." We were at first baffled on what to do. Why would a tree need a computer? So we started brainstorming about why a human needs a computer. Answers include: for analysis, for communication, for entertainment, for calculation. So we decided to apply these answers to plants/trees. We came up with a prototype computer system that would help a tree thrive/analyze and communicate. In our brainstorm, we decided the tree would have light sensors, temperature sensor, a sensor for moisture in the soil. Trees would also be sitting in planters/pots that would be on wheels and have a mobility system :) If light increases or is high, the tree would send a signal out that light levels are high in their location. If light level falls, the tree would move locations randomly, or would move toward other trees that are reporting higher light levels. If temperature falls to a set degree, a tap would bore into the tree so it could release sap into a collection tub. If moisture is too low, a reserve of water would release water to the soil.

_update: Gabriella Levine told us about Ivan Henrique. Check out his Jurema Action Plant, a surprisingly similar-sounding project. "Jurema Action Plant is an interactive bio-machine. It consists in a customized machine which interfaces a sensitive plant (Mimosa pudica). Jurema Action Plant aims to empower plants by enabling them to use similar technologies as humans use."_
