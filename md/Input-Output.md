**Create a programming Language**

*   Draw a triangle inside of a circle inside of a square.
*   Produce a drawing that can execute this.
*   A computer language that allows you to describe the process that would create this drawing.
*   Why would you want to describe that as a series of steps.
*   What goes into programming, graphical, text-based, music-based, physical.
*   There are a variety of ways of conveying information.
*   Think of styles, syntax, and symbols.
*   Its useful to stand from a standpoint of rethinking computers and computation.
*   You should be able to create documentation for your language so that someone else could write in it.

**Poetic side of things**

*   A trap to get stuck talking about tools and tool building.
*   Try to branch in different directions and see the poetry.
