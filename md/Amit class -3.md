Top down ideas

  Will always be diluted as being built

  The shell might be made by the end, but its not what you wanted

  Requried knowledge of whats possible in the medium

Bottom up ideas

  Don't know what the result will be, if it will be satisfactory

  Until you figure out what process/situation promotes the ideas that you find satisfactory, must be comfortable with ambiguity
