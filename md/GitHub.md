Git vs. GitHub

*   Git is just a way to track all changes
*   GitHub is a location that stores your code and keeps track of its iterations with versioning

GitHub terminology

*   init - starting a new project
*   add - adding a file will put it in staging, not committing to a branch 
*   commit - putting new code into a project 
*   branch - new repo of files
*   in command line "ls al" - show all the git files 
*   fetch - grab the changes from the server but don't merge them with my local files
*   pull - it's a fetch plus a merge, it will update your files with the latest version
*   reset - this will revert you to an earlier version

Getting started with 'Git' in Terminal

1.  cd to the folder you want to use to store the code 
2.  type 'git init'
3.  after you have files that you want to be tracked by version control, type 'git status' to see what is not commited
4.  you can add files with 'git add textfile.txt' *where 'textfile.txt' is the file name of what you want to add to the project

        1.  'git add .' will add all files

5.  type 'git commit' to commit the file

Getting started with GitHub

1.  create a new repository and grab the URL
2.  choose how to move files over 

        1.  push from command line or upload files from your machine
    2.  can also use 'SourceTree' if you want to work with a GUI and not terminal (also shows diff)
