Name: [Guglielmo Torelli](https://www.behance.net/iamgugo)

Gender: Male

Desired Location: as close as possible to the school, I would like to go there by bike. It would also be nice to share a place with others sfpc students.

Pets ok: I love pets.

Who are you and what are you looking for:

I'm a 26 year old open-minded Italian guy who is living in shared flats since 8 years ago. I'm also hosting couchsurfers from all over the world since 2011. So I know how to behave when I have to share a living place with other people.

I can cook very good stuff. I'm not vegeterian but I can stay without eating meat for long times (last workshop I did we had just vegan food).

I'm looking for a place to live for the ten weeks of the course; a place in which I can meet new people, not speaking my language and have good times.
