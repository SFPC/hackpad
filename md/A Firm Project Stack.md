(from the first question 'proposition')

**What are difference between poem and lyric?**

form, melodic, motif, etc. 

What are rules that distinguishing them?

*   navigation time? - time-based/rhythmic structure vs subjective pace 

        *   politics of choice

                *   karaoke for reading, something like [](http://www.spritzinc.com/)[http://www.spritzinc.com/](http://www.spritzinc.com/)
        *   classroom's required readings
        *   national anthem

*   perceived space? - empty space between lettering vs instrumental background

        *   does reading have to be visual? 

                *   haptic for the blind
        *   can we read through sound? taste? space?  

*   action verb? - read poem vs sing lyric
*   same production verb - write
*   same fundamental elements - word, language
*   medium-attached definite aesthetic? - lyrical poem vs poetic lyric

_I'm also interested in Karaoke as cultural readymade and a crossover space between these two mediums. _

*   It's similar to poem reading,

        *   affordance and participatory practice around reading, singing, performing

*   can be both individual and social; personal and performative, 
*   and also carrying sense of technological loneliness in its name.

from Wikipedia {

Karaoke カラオケ, [bimoraic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_(Japanese_prosody)) [clipped compound](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipped_compound) of Japanese 

*   _kara_ 空 "empty" and 
*   _ōkesutora_ オーケストラ "orchestra"

}

**version with obvious project agenda **:)

**How make intervention with Karaoke to create fun/poetic experience and also raise political awareness. **

 >>  some case studies would be great

 >> apps? instruction set? game? which medium? does it matter?

##  handfulOfBits

As I was working on getting this paper prototype to an app. I ended up stumbled upon the [hardware limitation](http://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/20449/keyboard-multiple-key-press-problem) of keyboard that you can't press more than six keys at once. The OF examples that I'm playing with this idea on OS X can be found here: [](https://github.com/firmread/firm_sfpc/tree/master/handfulOfByte)https://github.com/firmread/firm_sfpc/tree/master/handfulOfByte. 

 Then I decided to move on to iPad app instead, since 11 points multitouch should not disappoint me this time. 

 It works great now the pixel in the middle represent the current value of 8 bit data determined by button pressed.

 **Next step**

*   nice animation << 
*   nice sonic feedback << patatap.com-inspired indeed!
*   level design << look at how typing tutor kind of pattern mastering level

## bitPlane awesomeness

 I really like stuffs that going on in 5-7th bits: looks like screen-printable, glitchesthetics kinda patterns

 it ran on iPad too!

 maybe use these planes to masking some sick shaders stuffs could make awesome interactive live visual

**step 1**

os x version

*   bitplane selector
*   mask shader with bitplane
*   nice rainbow shader

*   shader by hiro!

**step 2**

**step 3**

make iOS version + live code shader from os x

hook this up with live shader on the computer

connected through [](http://www.bittorrent.com/sync/developers/api)http://www.bittorrent.com/sync/developers/api

iOS app with camera bitplane selector

and mac that share shader file,,, have to test this...

**getting video feed from gopro**

i just happen to like the word

## Scale of computation

COMPUTER KEEP GETTING SMALLER AND SMALLER

that is what we see

HUMAN KEEP LOOKS BIGGER AND BIGGER

maybe that's how computer from different generation looking back at us. 

*   this is a really interesting idea. ill think about this problem too. 

Just like in _Species of Spaces and Other Pieces _Georges Perec's narrative go through his perceived scale from:

*   the bed
*   the bedroom
*   the apartment
*   the apartment building
*   the street
*   the neighborhood
*   the town
*   the countryside
*   the country
*   europe
*   the world
*   space

just like how Bjork said that inside tv is a city (and icelandic poet's lie part is quite interesting too)

*

[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75WFTHpOw8Y)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75WFTHpOw8Y

if NAND gate is the most basic logic. what it's looks like in these scale? 

*   transistor, resistors, components << maybe these could consider human? since I can't really break myself apart as human condition :P
*   gates, logic building blocks // one-bit memory << like a house, a family 
*   super low level (~4 bit) << should already looks kinda like a small neighborhood
*    8-bit NES-like stuffs << welcome to a city
*   16-bit << maybe a bit art deco, high rises, skyscrapers / FFVI, steampunk vs magic
*   32 bit mac << now dense city mixed new/old building
*   64 bit stuffs << bright futurist world

*   look into Hardware description languages that use NAND and others as building block 
*   [](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHDL)
*   [](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHDL)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHDL 
*   [](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog 
*   ![](https://hackpad-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/hackpad.com_hb2hDEJ722N_p.77239_1398516651095_undefined)

if i compare the size of transistor in each era to human scale and maybe visualize that?

making some story?

## codewalk

how to annotate code idea while walking

sound is great as way to capture moments without much tools

drawing also great but it need you to stop walking

## Name and memories

from my story on the lightning talk day

name attached to certain memories, i tried to get them all called so that the don't just attach to distant memories. 

would the name that is no longer be called corrupted on the memory?

something between this two tuesday assignment from zach

*   **b)** tell a story using variable names.  you code should compile, but also be interesting and evocative to read as text. focus on code as text, can you play with this?  
*   Look at poems by apollinaire.   outrageous examples can be found in the obfuscated code contest ([](http://www.ioccc.org/2000/bmeyer.c))[http://www.ioccc.org/2000/bmeyer.c](http://www.ioccc.org/2000/bmeyer.c)) and also in ishac's code poems:
*   [](http://www.creativeapplications.net/processing/code-poems-by-ishac-bertran-poetry-with-code/)[http://www.creativeapplications.net/processing/code-poems-by-ishac-bertran-poetry-with-code/](http://www.creativeapplications.net/processing/code-poems-by-ishac-bertran-poetry-with-code/) 
*   (there should be a copy at school)

 and

*   **e)** play with memory in weird ways - make programs that crash.

auto biography about object called firm

what could the other names be? pointer? or inheritance?

all names refer to me but they also have their own story...

*   i do this kind of stuff for living. i can talk about how to make a living from it.
