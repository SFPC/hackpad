**Communicative Capitalism**

Intro capitalist communication.

**   _I take the position that contemporary communications media capture their users in intensive and extensive networks of enjoyment, production, and surveillance. My term for this formation is communicative capitalism. Just as industrial capitalism relied on the exploitation of labor, so does communicative_
*   _capitalism rely on the exploitation of communication_

...............................

*   _a constitutive feature of communicative capitalism is precisely this morphing of message into contribution…The message is simply part of a circulating data stream. Its particular content is irrelevant. Who sent it is irrelevant. Who receives it is irrelevant. That it need be responded to is irrelevant. The only thing that is relevant is circulation, the addition to the pool. Any particular contribution remains secondary to the fact of circulation” (58)._

...............................

*   _Dean thinks that “the intense circulation of content in communicative capitalism forecloses the antagonism necessary for politics” ( 54). On the one hand, this is basically the “slactivism” objection. On the other hand, it’s more nuanced than that: Dean thinks that communications have been evacuated of all use value–words have no power anymore, they’re just fungible units of value, like money. This means we can neither (a) debate their substance, nor (b) use speech as a political tool to effect changes in policies, laws, and the organization of society._

Content is monetized, communication becomes the prime matter of capitalism, so volume of communication (or "circulation of content") is monetizable. This fundamentally alters the nature of discourse in general, and the "antagonism" or counterbalancing power of political discourse in particular.

*   What are some ways communication is being monetized / valued / capitalized? Discuss some examples.

        *   Social media
    *   News that live of articles being shared virally
    *   Yelp - more reviews (circulation) the better rating

*   How does understanding communication as formal exchangeable goods alter its nature? What is added, what is subtracted from the object?
*   What kind of society is facilitated by this new understanding of communicative units? 
*   Are there models that incentivize "engaging" or having a deeper interaction with content, instead of adding to the circulation? (_Unfinished thought)_
*   How do civil society, grassroots movements, political activism get transformed by these changes?
*   What do we as humans get out of capitalization of sharing and communication? // What are some alternatives to the monetization of communication in its current form?
*   What does "sharing" mean? 

**Communities and sharing**

*   _What’s crucial to realize is that proponents of “sharing” are reinventing our understanding of economic relations between individuals so that they no longer imply individualism, greed or self-interest. Instead, we’re led to believe that commerce conducted on their platforms is ultimately about generosity, helpfulness, community-building, and love._

*   _We literally stand on the brink of a new, better kind of economic system that delivers social as well as economic benefits. The old system centralizes production, wealth and control… the peer sharing economy is a new model that distributes wealth, power and control to everyone else. Best of all, the very things that have become the casualties of the old economy—things like economic independence, entrepreneurialism, community, individuality, happiness—it’s actually built into the very structure of this new economy. _

*   Go to Airbnb, Kickstarter, Lyft, WholeFoods, TED, KickStarter, Etsy, or any site that you think may fit. Note terms in their sites whose meaning you think has been recently morphing or is being abused years.
*   Describe these changes.

## The Cult of Sharing

"By conflating political action and market transaction, they are able to claim that their products are no mere trifling gadgets or mundane information processors, but serve a higher purpose. [...] Instead of purchasing, the new demand that we participate carries even stronger political sounding connotations."

"It misrepresents consumer choice as a form of empowerment, and turns the market into a field for social change. It tells us that public, democratic decision-making is clumsy, slow, a boondoggle, incapable of innovation, or an intractable deadlock that is best ignored while tech entrepreneurs get on with the business of changing the world through capitalism."

"One such higher purpose often invoked by technology marketing is the promise of community. We’re told that technology can restore a sense of community that modern people have lost, and this can be achieved through greater connectivity, collaboration, communication and participation brought by digital networks."

"What role does marketing play in the construction of communities around a business? "

"As much as conventional brand managers think that projecting a compelling system of values to consumers, human interaction is what really gets people in the door and makes them stick around. "

"If a cult is first a community and then an ideology, it follows that fostering social interactions and the formation of ties among members of a cult brands is crucial. To build cult brands, businesses should build community, and Atkin thinks businesses are well-suited to building just the kinds of communities that modern people want: looser, more ad hoc communities that require less commitment and where members are bound together less because of a shared geography, and more because of common interests and ideas."

"It’s a strange kind of logic that claims that we have nothing to fear from cult brands because they tap into consumers’ real desires for connection and community. In fact, that’s precisely why we should be afraid. Isn’t it terrifying to think that brands can reach us at such an intimate level?

"Cities used to be villages. Everyone knew each other, and everyone knew they had a place to call home. But after the mechanization and Industrial Revolution of the last century, those feelings of trust and belonging were displaced by mass-produced and impersonal travel experiences. We also stopped trusting each other. And in doing so, we lost something essential about what it means to be a community. […] At a time when new technologies have made it easier to keep each other at a distance, [Airbnb users are] using them to bring people together. And you’re tapping into the universal human yearning to belong—the desire to feel welcomed, respected, and appreciated for who you are, no matter where you might be."

What’s crucial to realize is that proponents of “sharing” are reinventing our understanding of economic relations between individuals so that they no longer imply individualism, greed or self-interest. Instead, we’re led to believe that commerce conducted on their platforms is ultimately about generosity, helpfulness, community-building, and love.

It’s what enables TaskRabbit to claim that hiring a stranger to do your laundry, perhaps for less than minimum wage, is really about “neighbors helping neighbors,” as they put it. The company’s mission is to “revolutionize the way people work — by redefining what it means to be neighborly.”

We literally stand on the brink of a new, better kind of economic system that delivers social as well as economic benefits. The old system centralizes production, wealth and control… the peer sharing economy is a new model that distributes wealth, power and control to everyone else. Best of all, the very things that have become the casualties of the old economy—things like economic independence, entrepreneurialism, community, individuality, happiness—it’s actually built into the very structure of this new economy.

"When marketing executives at “values-led” companies try to cultivate communities around ethical consumerism, it creates a new class of problems. Much like religious cults, cult brands manipulate their customers’ emotional and psychological needs and encourage them to construct their identities and lives around the brand. The collapse of the ideal would be felt as a personal catastrophe for its community, so the brand becomes practically immune to criticism."
