**Day 1**

*   Create their own computer vision library. [#idea](https://moises404.hackpad.com/ep/search/?q=%23idea3learning&via=x1d05NEslZG)s[4](/ep/search/?q=%23idealearning&via=3EkjrZWnTNN)[learning](https://moises404.hackpad.com/ep/search/?q=%23idea3learning&via=x1d05NEslZG)

        *   Statistical, deriving.

*   Two types of Algorythms

        *   Brute Force (For Loops)

                *    (muscle algorithms)
        *   Lots of pixels, nested For Loops

        *   Brain Algorythms

                *   Deriving information (statistics, smart things)

*   The things that you learn when thinking about images have great resonance when thinking about images.
*   Data Visualization, Signal Analysis.
*   Resolutions, Sizes

        *   1024 x 768 (XGA)
    *   640 x 480 (VGA)
    *   1920 x 1080 (HD)

                *   'i' means interlaced or not
        *   renders every other line

*   How big in size is a 640 x 480 image.

        *   Assume that is three channels
    *   921,600 / 1024 = .88 mb
    *   Theres a ton of information there, plus each frame.

*   Our job is take this thing that has alot of information and to still it down.

        *   A Funnel: still it down into smaller pieces of information.

*   How images are laid down in memory.

*   **Libraries, Tools and Approaches**

*   **Phototomemitry**

*   **Images**

*   **Synthesize images**

*   **Mosaic**

*   **Small Aissignment**

*   **Asking Pixels Questions**

*   **PushMatrix & PopMatrix**

*   **Frequency Information**

*   **Aritist & Projects**

*   **History**

*   Bartiene System
*   Typography automatic systems for drawing.

        *   People were designing these kinds of type faces in 1912.

*   The future of art is set to include computer wizardry [#quote](https://moises404.hackpad.com/ep/search/?q=%23quote&via=x1d05NEslZG)

**Day 2**

*   One of the most important things in computer vision is understanding statistics.

*   **Asking Questions about Pixels**

        *   **Connectivity**

    *   **Binary Data** (Foreground, Background)

    *   READING: Vision by David Mar

*   **Connected Components**

*   **Pattern Recognition**

*   **Morphological Operators**

*   **CV and Animation**
