# [Spring 2014 questions](/dCyW52sNETV)

Please write your name for the questions.   

_Think specifically is there one question you'd like your research to focus on?  Your question can be anywhere from practical to profound.   _

**Diana **

How do you want others to remind your voice?

How can we convert our own resonance body in part of a orchestra? Which are the silent orchestras that we are surrounded by?

How a poem is constructed or deconstructed? is while typing? Or while reading? Both? Cleared when I pause? 

How do you transform a place that is far away from you? - telelandscapes. 

**Daniel**

What does my personal graph of diminishing returns look like in terms of learning technical skills (given my other interests)?

**Ida**

**firm**

What are difference between poem and lyric?

form, melodic, motif, etc. 

What are rules that distinguishing them?

*   navigation time? - time-based/rhythmic structure vs subjective pace 

        *   politics of choice

                *   karaoke for reading, something like [](http://www.spritzinc.com/)[http://www.spritzinc.com/](http://www.spritzinc.com/)
        *   classroom's required readings
        *   national anthem

*   perceived space? - empty space between lettering vs instrumental background

        *   does reading have to be visual? 

                *   haptic for the blind
        *   can we read through sound? taste? space?  

*   action verb? - read poem vs sing lyric
*   same production verb - write
*   same fundamental elements - word, language
*   medium-attached definite aesthetic? - lyrical poem vs poetic lyric

_I'm also interested in Karaoke as cultural readymade and a crossover space between these two mediums. _

*   It's similar to poem reading,

        *   affordance and participatory practice around reading, singing, performing

*   can be both individual and social; personal and performative, 
*   and also carrying sense of technological loneliness in its name.

from Wikipedia {

Karaoke カラオケ, [bimoraic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_(Japanese_prosody)) [clipped compound](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipped_compound) of Japanese 

*   _kara_ 空 "empty" and 
*   _ōkesutora_ オーケストラ "orchestra"

**Hiro**

Random crude questions I should narrow down and elaborate...

*   What is the primary thing that technology derived us of? Is it possible to get them back by technology?
*   What can technology do to make our daily interaction "a bit more human"?
*   If there’s the media that sits right between analog and digital, what do they look like?
*   People voluntarily share their location, name, what they eat, etc. where is the limit of sharing themselves?
*   Can we physically share something over the internet? Print...?
*   Marshmallow test over the internet? Anyway to measure Realtime gratification and delayed gratification.
*   Another ways to experience the web other than screens?
*   Is it possible to physically visualize data?
*   What if you can create / manipulate your own shadow?

        *   Cut / Paste parts of shadows.
    *   Sequence of shadows with time offsets casted on floor right next to your own shadow.
    *   What if each shadow decided to move independent of own shadow?
    *   What if shadow has lifetime limit?

*   How can i make the web tangible
*   What is the best way to learn circuits and physical computing, and what's the most important point that's fundamental to understanding the topic?
*   Is there any way to learn physical computing from the products around us?

**Shobun**

*   How to draw attention to the differences between realities based off large sets of data, experienced through an interface (and compressed in space and time i.e. climate change, or history)  and realities based off more easily accessible human experience (light, scent, touch, memory existing within the course of a given life-span)?  And can we use digital technologies to create alternative (RELEVANT & REMEMBERED) visceral experiences out of events and data that can only be interfaced through data vis methods? 
*   Is there a way to keep the infrastructure and metabolism of digital tools visible in UIs? Basically, how to integrate the growing discourse on #stacktivism into the creation of new artwork that uses digital tools?

**Alex Z**

How do we re-negotiate how we read? For the most part we read in one direction from point A to point B in an manner based upon time unfolding linearly. However, when one executes code (multiple algorithms can run simultaneously regardless of what order they are on the page) or delves into the theories of quantum mechanics (relativity, space-time), one sees that linear thought is only one way to express how the world unfolds. 

How do we express the essence of our ever changing relation to time through text? How do we express the multiplicity of time inside the nuts and bolts of the code? Can words unfold and collapse in different ways based upon how and where the viewer approaches an interface? 

**Nathan's Question**

How do I tie sound and generative/programmatic moving image together in a way that's compelling - as watchable as narrative "music video"? (It can rely on one idea - see:  [this AOKI takamasa video](https://vimeo.com/63636256))

*   How do we keep it from being obvious (like when something follows a mouse cursor)?
*   Can it also be interactive without being gimmicky?
*   What if the sound was programmatically generated too?

**Alexander**

*   Do new ways of sensing change the shape of our physical world?
*   Does how/what we see effect our behavior?

**Ryota (yoyo)**

*   How do you come up with ideas when you make something?
*   new types of screen
*   Fabrication gives big changes in media art?
*   gopro with openframeworks

**Zak**

*   _What is the ideal balance between performative and intimate social spaces, and are they at odds?_
*   How do you optimize away from performativeness and toward intimacy?
*   Can performative behavior online (or offline) be healthy and fulfilling for the right person, with the right balance?
*   Can establishing barriers to intimate content be a way to foster an intimate space without using encryption?
*   Is a goal of maximum inclusiveness at odds with a goal of establishing an intimate space?

**Scott:**

*   How can you map the digital experience of a physical space?
*   How can we map the physical spaces of digital experiences?
*   Can augmented reality be done without GPS or CV (an in-between/room scale)?
*   What's the cheapest/easiest setup for SLAM/Simultaneous Localization and Mapping?
*   What's the cheapest 3D Scanner we can make?
*   What's the cheapest eyetracking get up? Does it need to be goggle based?
*   Can we create an AR experience of the Met's entire collection?
*   Can Google's Project Tango be replicated with a cell phone and a Kinect?
