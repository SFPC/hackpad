**Expression Reactive Photo Booth**

Projected image funfair photobooth - the participant's expression defines the expressions on the projected image. eg - when the participant smiles to have the photo taken then the projected faces all stick their tongues out.

**In bed with our machines**

Photographs of the class in bed with their laptops, phones, ipads etc

I need to find a clever way of taking this pic.. i can ask my roommate, but what if the laptop takes picture itself? 

It would be great if your roommate could do it - problem with the laptop taking the photo is that the laptop is not in the photo....

**Emotional Furniture**

An arm chair that pats you on the back.

A table that acts like a loyal dog and picks up a leg (paw) and rests it on your knee

A voting machine that always records yes - even if you vote no or anything else.

**Other Thoughts**

Face polisher

Problem-solving booth

Lesson that is paid for in real-time dollar by dollar when the participant feels they have learnt something of value, 

i think this dollar to dollar learning will be more interesting if it's done in alternative currency. Hard currency will make it fee like teachers are strippers or beggars. 

I understand how you feel - but to me the direct link with the money is the most important thing - it is the way we assign value to things - giving money is something we do in thousands of situations - I am interested in why it feels culturally demeaning to be paid for something as you are doing it rather than in advance in anticipation of what you will recieve in return.
