# 2014 BIG (and little) QUESTIONS

## lee/hiro/zak questions

*   how do i use/do github, irc, circuit bending?
*   how can i make the web tangible? (something you can manipulate/touch)

Z:

*   What is the ideal balance between performative and intimate spaces? Are they at odds?
*   How do you optimize away from performative and toward intimacy?
*   Can performative behavior online be healthy and fulfilling sometimes?
*   Is performative behavior online tied to capitalism, “meritocracy,” or egalitarian ideas about people?
*   How do you design a social space that promotes a non-hierarchical view of humanity?

        *   ie. one where people are not measured numerically

*   Do numerical measurements (linear) promote a simplistic system of assigning value to people?
*   What is the difference between an environment that values everyone equally and a cult?
*   Can "better" (at fostering intimacy) social spaces influence a shift away from capitalism globally? How?
*   Does social currency (likes, RTs, favorites, followers) serve as a stnad-in for career status, money, rewards for a generation shut out from them?

        *   see Jaron Lanier, _You Are Not A Gadget_

*   How are kids and teends responding to spaces that skew performative? How are they being subverted?

        *   Dana Boyd: kids mentioning brands ironically. Coca-cola = cocaine; culture jamming

*   Why am I so concerned with this stuff?
*   How can a social network subvert the tendency to self-brand?

**[Alexander Porter](/ep/profile/CmJtyfdsaNb)'s Questions **

Why am I here? Why did I feel compelled to learn more about computation etc? 

Is it actually necessary to understand computation practically (not metaphorically) to understand today's world? 

What's the deal with the singularity? Why are all my artist/technologically oriented friends obsessed with it?

What does it mean to _see_ something/someone. I often assert that it has much to do with power, where does that physically appear in the world?

What are the characteristics/aesthetics inherent to: 

*   images made by humans for humans
*   images made by humans for machines
*   images made by machines for humans
*   images made by machines for machines

To what degree does the program – the instructions that enable & limit the range for use & utility – of a tool inflect its use?

What are methods for expanding/altering that 'program.' 

*   modification.
*   combination (with something else.) 
*   re-contextualization.

Can seeing an image actually have an effect on our world view? Our behaviors? 

What happens when one sees from another person (or thing's) perspective. 

Does knowing about something on a granular level make a difference? 

What's the deal with behavior change? 

What changes in our worldview when we know everything about everything? 

Does knowing where we are all the time change our sense of where we are? 

Does understanding how things work help make better/more critical work? 

Do I actually want to be an artist in the traditional mode? Why does that sound embarrassing?

If I'm concerned about the implications of technologies, does adopting them, even critically, make me 'part of the problem?' 

Can play and/or humor, satire, etc. be an effective agent in changing behavior around technology? 

What (or who) is a good model for what I'm interested in pursuing?

Do I have to follow one line of inquiry? What about three?

Is criticality essential for this kind of work?

Is there a living, a way of life in this? Can I reconcile the model of just doing own art projects , then immediately using them for corporate needs?

How do I create the kind of time that I need to think and play and still make a living. 

To what degree is being technically proficient needed/helpful in the work I'm doing? 

How can I develop a practice where I publish, present, release the products of my efforts? 

When is something done or ready?

Why am I reticent of the impulse to just make things nifty?

Why am I so reticent of the adorable outsider hacker/tinkerer mythos?

What does it mean to take images now? 

What should the information contained in images without intent of encoding be called? If I can discover information, infer information from a turn-of the century photo is that metadata? 

Why does everything take so goddamn long?

How deep do I want to go with this stuff? Am I just distracting myself? 

To what degree should I resist the siren call of nifty new skills? 

Why is novelty so valued. What are the traditions that can be traced from new technologies to traditional methods?
