# Call for Spring 2015 

*   We are working on editing call for students, to make it more welcoming and clear. pls comment and help!

 School for poetic computation (SFPC) will host an intensive ten weeks session in New York City from March 1st - May 8. SFPC is an ideal environment for students to develop and further a deep curiosity of what it means to work poetically in computational media.

SFPC is not a technical bootcamp. Rather, it is an opportunity to work intensively with a small group of faculty, visiting artists and peers to explore artistic freedom through computation. Computation is poetic when technology is used for critical thinking and aesthetic inquiry – a space where logic meets electricity (hardware), math meets language (software) and analytical thinking meets creative experimentation.

SFPC has held three successful sessions to date, a ten week course in Fall 2013 that culminated in an exhibition at [Eyebeam Art and Technology Center](http://eyebeam.org/), and two week session in Spring of 2014 and ten week course in Fall 2014 held at [Orbital](http://orbitalnyc.com/) in Lower East Side.

The Spring 2015 sessions will continue to focus on two areas of research which we are calling: new audiences and assistive technology.

With new audiences, we will be trying to answer the question, “how can we spread what we care about far and wide and to diverse new groups?” Students focused on this track will be engaged in teaching and designing tools, systems, and approaches to help bring poetic computation to far flung places and communities.

With assistive technology, we will examine how computation and artistic works can be enabling forces, helping people overcome challenges, and offering new means of communication and expression. SFPC will be partnering with several institutions and individuals in the NYC area to explore and refine these approaches.

The idea behind these interconnected “tracks” is to build on SFPC’s core curriculum by exploring the common ground which we can take the ideas developed in our classroom space into the streets. We see them as platforms to help promote fearless prototyping, asking difficult questions and creating projects that embody issues that are not yet commonly addressed in the art / tech world.

Feel free to reach out to us if you have questions about the school: info@sfpc.io

**Who is going to teach?**

[Zachary Lieberman](http://thesystemis.com/), [Taeyoon Choi](http://taeyoonchoi.com/), [Amit Pitaru](http://www.pitaru.com/), Tega Brain  __**_ MORE TEACHERS here___** as well as a variety of other workshop leaders and visiting artists.

What will happen in ten weeks?

*   17 participants in one session.
*   24/7 access to work space at Orbital, 155 Rivington Street, in Manhattan’s Lower East Side.
*   Daily classes on programming, electronics, history and theory of computation and related topics.
*   Classes vary in length and they are usually held from Monday ~ Friday between 10AM and 5PM.
*   Teachers and mentors available for technical, conceptual and artistic guidance.
*   Workshops with visiting artists.
*   Visits to institutions, schools and art spaces.
*   Reading and discussion group.
*   Weekly dinners with special guests.
*   Peer to peer collaboration is highly encouraged among participants.

**Who are we looking for?**

We are looking for participants from diverse backgrounds: artists, programmers, educators, writers and anyone with a passion to explore poetic computation. Our only expectation is that you are eager to experiment, can learn from failure, and come fully dedicated to this ten week experience. In the past, we have had students with diverse technical experiences and we were delighted to find out that everyone had something to learn from our classes and each other. A group of faculty leads a selection process that is based on applicant’s answers to an application form, work samples, and short interviews.

**How much is tuition?**

Ten weeks program will cost $5000 USD. The tuition goes to paying for space, teachers and materials. We think transparency in finance shares the spirit of transparency in education, and have been actively publishing our financial documents.

**Application deadline **

We are going to accept Early Applications on a rolling basis from November 8th to December 10th. We are planning to accept early applicants in order for them to apply for grants and plan travels. A select group of early applicants will be notified by December 20th. We will accept applications until December 31st, 2014 and notify everyone by January 10th. 

Please **[apply here!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1qKQj3CJ9_TVD7iQjLaRyljEAIMMmI1pdDFfK2Bdtziw/viewform?pli=1)** In the past, we received 80+ strong applications and this time will likely be competitive as well. The admissions committee, comprising of teachers and alumni of SFPC, select participants based on work sample and application form.   Participants are expected to plan their travel and we do our best to help find accommodation.

**What is the School for poetic computation?**

SFPC is an alternative school for art and technology. We are striving to create a mode of education based on collaboration between faculty and students. By participating you will be actively shaping an emerging culture of open source and transparent education.
