# Archiving and Documentation

**Why document?**

*   Importance of documenting. A sort of kindness on a basic level.
*   Scrappy. Unedited. Record what weâ€™re doing. Could be boring as hell. 
*   If someone wants to take it from there and make it professional they can do it.
*   Writing something down and organizing it is a good way of learning / remembering.
*   Helps w/ larger involvement in the outside world

**Tools**

*   Taeyoon's camera is always lying around. Use it as needed.

        *   likewise my t3i is also around usually.  Might not have an SD card in it (BYOSD)

*   iPhone lavalier
*   Screencasts

        *   to record commandline screencasts, try <u>[ascii.io](http://ascii.io/)</u>

                *   as a side note, for broadcasting the terminal, tmate looks interesting

        *   to record basic desktop screencasts

                *   <u>[quicktime is free](http://support.apple.com/kb/PH5882)</u>
        *   [screenflow](http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/), makes screen recording dirt easy
        *   for high res captures, I've used blackmagic intensity HDMI capture (computer to computer ).  I have a box as needed.  this is to get 1x1 capture for fine details.
