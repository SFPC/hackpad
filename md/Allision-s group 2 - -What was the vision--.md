# Allision's group 2 - "What was the vision?"

**Toru: vision**

* similaraties between three readings what facilitate "means" when our technology is becoming more limited (e.g. iphone) vs tech from 80's

* flower example on page 78

**Lauren: Teaching vision to creators - two challenges**

1.  You have to teach how to create:

There are obstacles of getting people involved in tech

*   "cultural toxins" of i'm a math oriented person or a 'creative' (mindstorms)

        *   binary day when EVERYONE said "Ugh i hate math"
    *   Ramsey it's ok, programming sucks - learn basics and build mastery

*    people understand what they have experienced 

        *   having a car, more likely to know how to change a tire
    *   _I still consider the fundamental fact about learning: Anything is easy if you can assimilate it to your collection of models. If you can't, anything can be pain- fully difficult._ (mindstorms)

*   Teachers need to be trained and also inspired to teach

        *   _Of course it's (educational CS living up to his vision) taking foreverâ€”because the adults are the intermediaries, and they don't like math and science. (kay)_

1.  You have to teach them what to create:

Teaching tools may not be as important as teaching them to think critically about what they are making with the tools and why

**Show and tell**

Lauren's experiences with a video toaster in the 90's  

1.  feeling of mastery over something most grownups felt powerless around made me fearless.  allowed me to learn at an accelerated rate through college and most of my career - 'done it before can do it again'
2.  working within a journalistic and collaborative framework taught me how to present a news story vs. an opinion piece - bias, research, multiple pov... responsibility to viewers to be upfront with you intention, not misleading

* did this steep learning curve help us feel more comfortable with technology then kids who grow up w imovie or an ipad music maker (look at those buttons on mario paint)

**What is your vision of what technology should be?**

*   Toru: using computer is becoming 'normal' (less special) . It's harder to notice the benifit of what computers can do because it is so normal. we have to review the visions of the pioneers again, 

Todd: it's a driverless car. it's a 'providing content tool'
