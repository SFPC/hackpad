# Dumpling Computing

**Topics (in order of what I think would be most useful for people)**

*   protocols and why the internet is not the web

        *   how HTTP works, connecting to APIs, and using TELNET to hand-craft hipster packets

*   physical computing

        *   how to connect the virtual to the physical with arduino, connecting arduino to the web

*   security, information theory

        *   how to send secret messages, early computing history and how to run your own web services

*   grab bag

        *   any project from [](http://jonathan.is)http://j[o](http://j)[n](http://jo)[a](http://jon)[t](http://jona)[h](http://jonat)[a](http://jonath)[n](http://jonatha)[.i](http://jonathan)[s](http://jonathan.i) or from [](http://jedahan.com)http://jedahan.com I can go through how I made it

1:30 - Write your name and what topic you are interested in (internet, security, physical, node, grabbag)

1. Ida (protocols, info theory, node)

2. Shobun (physical computing, info theory)

3. firm ( node, protocols, info theory) 

4. Lee (how to run own web services/scripts, grab bag- You Only Die Once, security, api, http protocol shit, connecting arduino to web, etc - all this shit)

5. yoyo(basic theory,api,protocol,making network for arduino)

6. 

3:30 - Write your name and what topic you are interested in (internet, security, physical, node, grabbag)

1. Ida (protocols, info theory, node)

2. Oscar (internet, info theory)

3. Daniel (security, phys com)

4. Connecting to the internet. (or networking with Bluetooth or WebSocket, and how to keep it running.)

6. Alex Z (Motion sensing, integrating arduino with video projection) 

zac my friend's did a cool audio/visual project installed in a dance club with arduino i think you would be into [](http://skeptic.al/#work_195)http://skeptic.al/#work_195

**Xbee (wireless communications)**

1.  YOYO
2.  Daniel: Is this still being considered as a session?

*    maybe not a full session but one evening I can try and find some time to show how 2 xbees can talk to one another

(@JD I have a ton of xbees that can be put into transparent mode if you need.  requires some familiarity with xctu to configure) 

*    [Zach Lieberman](/ep/profile/AUZb6pnTdHj) yeah please bring a few - I just want to show people what it looks like to configure them, and what the options mean

**Networked, physical computing with Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, and node.js**

11am Sunday

We will make a node.js application that interfaces with an api, and makes the arduino do stuff, all on a raspberry pi. Try and find some apis you want to mess with, or design ideas of what you would like to happen.
