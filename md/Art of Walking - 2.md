# Art of Walking # 2  

Assignment #2: 

Read Georges Perec's The Scene of a Flight. Write a short story about your journey from the past or present, or fiction. The writing must contain following paragraph in some way.  

_"When, twenty years later, he (she) undertook to remember (when, twenty years Later, I undertook to remember), everything at first was opaque and uncertain. The the details returned, one by one:..."   _

You may change parts of the paragraph to fit your story. The key reason for using the paragraph is to make a creative constraint for you to write a story about a journey and places over different times. The writing can be of any lenght or style, just remember this is just a chance for you to experiment in storytelling. 

Please send an email with your writing in PDF format  or in print (preferred) by Midnight of Thursday the 10th for me to review for our class on Friday. I will accept late assignment until Sunday the 13th. 

Thank you.
