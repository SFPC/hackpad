**Projects that (whimsically) came to mind prior to the course:**

*   Create landscape/reliefs by using photo forensic software and mapping ELA (or other alterations) to elevation. Apply to various images, sets and make various 'landscapes of manipulation.'

*   [](http://www.getghiro.org/)http://www.getghiro.org/ 

*   Create a camera that retrieves the image search result for the image you take, discards your image and presents the first search result in its place.
*   An image search video process – perform image search + crop to match for every frame of an image sequence. 
*   Make sequences (CG or generative) that convey the physical reality of 'materials intensity' & material throughput in our lives. Translate data about C02 consumption, materials use, waste etc. and make animations to visualize them. Ie: calculate actual C02 used during the course of a year and animate it falling at human scale.
*   Attempt to illustrate the odd similes used to put things in scales we can understand. For example (made up): the number of water bottles used per month would fill the empire state building. Could VR or animation overcome cognitive biases that prevent us from comprehending & comparing large numbers or minute risks?

*   Implement techniques from microscopy for scanning at a human level for computational portraiture? 

*   3D from EDF via focus stacking – [](http://bigwww.epfl.ch/demo/edf/)http://bigwww.epfl.ch/demo/edf/

*   Make 'found data' renderings using my collection of publicly available SLAM datasets. 

**Notes & Quotes:**

*   [Experimental photographers] are in fact consciously attempting to create unpredictable information, i.e. to release themselves from the camera, and to place within the image something that is not in its program. They know they are playing against the camera. Yet even they are not conscious of the consequence of their practice: they are not aware that they are attempting to address the question of freedom in the context of apparatus in general.
*   VILÉM FLUSSER from _Towards a Philosophy of Photography_

**Diary**

*   I worked a bit with [scott](/ep/profile/AFmNPnnCbtQ) trying to make sense of some ofxAddons with the intention of learning a bit about 3D & eventually making a demo to visualize environmental usage data at a 'human scale.' I found it to be _very _useful to work with someone else who is at around the same level of understanding to make sense of code. We found that just using xcode and getting the code to run accounted for ~75% of the time spent. But it was very exciting to start seeing things in 3D. Scott is an architect & I think spatially so I think we both found it useful to start drawing in 3D to understand principles.

*   I'm wondering about the best way to get something useful & lasting out of this incredibly brief period. Overnight I had some 'buyers remorse' in regards to the amount of time I've put aside for this and felt a deep concern about making the experience useful. I'm well aware that the responsibility lays with me so I'm working out ways to refine my experience here to get what I need. I think that that will come by reductively limiting my cognitive input – I'm finding that doing a sort of 'drive by' on a lot of these practices & techniques is incredibly beneficial in that I'm able to sort out what I _don't_ want to be working on. 

*   I have an existing community, references, resources etc. and I'm finding that in my work it's becoming increasingly important to limit and dig deep rather than skimming new materials. To that end I think it will be important to focus on two areas: refining my ideas in relation to my existing work & practice & use the presence of expertise to jump into projects that are outside my current range of expertise. 
**   To that end, the efforts I'm starting to focus on in order to make this practical for me are the following:
