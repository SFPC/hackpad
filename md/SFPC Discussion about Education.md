# SFPC Discussion about Education

*   Creating platform for learning to occur
*   the philosophy that could be shared, for learning to occur.
*   About an hour
*   Propose Questions
*   Out side of traditional Academy
*   Ideas of community building.
*   Teaching at ITP

        *   With Zach, 3D sensing class
    *   Been kind of teching alot of 2 credit classes

                *   First semester teachching a 12 week class

                        *   Difference between a free school model and SFPC

                *   Something are only possible in longer times
        *   Also have done one day workshops

                        *   6 to 9 hours + lunch
            *   There is different toopics you can teach in these environments

        *   Something similar to SFPC where poeple are sharing the space and being continously ambient about and other and the space.

                *   Teaching code for art program and creative projects.
        *   Started studying art in a grad program.

                        *   No one knew how to code.
            *   Most where working with editing video andcreating sounscapes.
            *   I felt like I was prepared, once I was in grad school.

                *   Not really what we run into at SFPC, RISD, and ITP

                        *   SImultaneusly learning about both.

                *   Such a range of backgrounds and skill level.

                        *   Traditional computer science.
            *   There is a bell curve.
            *   Not the same in an art context.

                                *   Don't want my students to feel like the fail.
                *   Hard to keep them engaged and challenge.

                        *   Hard to expand the range you are teaching to without diluting the teaching. #tip
            *   Technical stress is so incredible.
            *   Fine Art School is meant to be open-ended

                                *   To have both is quite a challenge.

*   Questions about the School

        *   Who came with strong technical background.
    *   Who came with poetry.
    *   Who came to learn about poetry.
    *   Who came to learn technical skills.

*   SFPC Reflections

        *   Things we we're struggling with teaching the technology to artistic people.
    *   We got to the computation in someway but how do you teach the poetry.
    *   How do you teach how to make a creative work.
    *   And instigation or provocation.
    *   Succeeded in someway, teaching the technology to artist is one thing but doing the opposite is another.

*   When I see something that is beautiful code how do I share that feeling.
*   Not knowing technical things became a way to learn poetry.

        *   Coding thinking is still little bit of a mystery.

*   Really hard to be reflective when you're doing something.

        *   If you don't reflect making the end product might not give a much feedback.

*   Techincal stuff is not easy to teach.

        *   You can give someone the feeling that is easily to learn things.
    *   Understand how to teach themselves further.
    *   COmes down alot to the way that people are dedicated about learning.
    *   THe students apporach about cultivating the right attitute towards learning.

*   Value in both everyone talking among each other.

**How do you teach the poetry?**

*   Unaswareable questions that stick with you.

        *   Dont happen everday.
    *   Presents a question to you.
    *   Those questions will nag you and stay with you.

                *   A situation that is inescaple.
        *   You can't learn about poetry without answaring those questions.

*   You can lear teachnicall things didacttily.
*   Collaboration is a really good way to learn abou someones processes.

        *   Alot of their processes will rub off on you.

*   Some where between didactic and collaboration.
*   What is art?

        *   What grade do you think you deserve.
    *   Not just about something you show in a classroom is about your commitment its about a full practice.
    *   Not just an artist for a couple of hours.

*   Run a creq in installation theatrical experiences.

        *   Creaitng experiences that connect rdirectly with what it means to be human.
    *   Typologies and true desires about human nature.
    *   Trying to make a tech project with maxMSP that relates to a typology seems to be a pretty good way to get people to start interacting with this stuff.
    *   They start moving away from technology.

**In what ways did not working for grades change the environment?**

*   There was room for failure.
*   Making everything optional, put the onus on the students to get things out of it.
*   How to carve out time space in order to go deep on something.
*   Its good that we were over subscribed we were able to pull out of it the things that were most interesting.

**What was your best educational experience?**

**Really good moment or favorite class or educational moment?**

**Public School**

*   Most of the classes has to be free

**Trade School**

*   Exchange of skills and values
*   Alternative currency.

**SFPC**

*   Quite hard to teach intensive technical things in a free school model.

*   Learning how to be an artist in the world, you can show them all the different ways that it can be doen.
*   THey have to see the path.

*   People used to make wikis.
*   What it looks like to teach a class right now.
*   Some kind of discussions that you can only have in person.
*   The more that you ask that question the more you feel you can outsource and ask those questions.

        *   Created a 6 minute video to solve an add on problem.

                *   Someone then emailed me about the watching the video and still didnt work.
        *   Always a little thing that seaps through.
